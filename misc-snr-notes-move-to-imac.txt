research:
    make an annotated bibliography
    take notes on all the historical SNRs
    learn about synchrotron emission, radiation, bremsstrahlung, whatnot
    learn about ejecta knots, SNR processes, morphology
    
    questions to answer: point spread functions, aperture photometry, light curve definition, spectral index, lots of terminology to learn.  What's an ejecta knot?






When thinking about region sizes/counts:
* SN 1006 has diameter 0.5 deg., vs. ~0.14 deg. for SN 1572
* But count rates are much higher for SN 1572

Diameters
SN 1006: 0.5 degrees
SN 1572: 0.14 degrees (= 8.4') [Tycho]
SN 1604: 0.07 degrees (= 4') [Kepler]
SN 1680: 0.08 degrees (= 5') [Cas A]

ACIS-I gives 16.9' x 16.9'
But for small sources, may as well use one chip:
ACIS-S3 gives best spectral resolution, 8.3' x 8.3'
so Kepler, Cas A can be nicely imaged

Crab (SN 1054): the SNR is difficult to see.  It's thought that the remnant is in an ISM cavity. [Seward, Gorenstein, Smith (2006) in x-ray] [Hester 2008 ARAA]

    Two more synchrotron-dominated shell SNRs were discovered in the late 1990s:
    RX J1713.7-3946 (Koyama et al. 1997, Slane et al. 1999) (also known as
    G347.3-0.5) and G266.2-1.2 (Vela Jr.) (Aschenbach 1998, Slane et al. 2001).
    Synchrotron components were inferred to be present in thin ﬁlaments at the
    edges of historical remnants Tycho (Hwang et al. 2002, Warren et al. 2005),
    Kepler (Cassam-Chena¨ı et al. 2004a), and Cas A (Bleeker et al. 2001,
    Gotthelf et al. 2001), and a synchrotron continuum added to thermal emission
    satisfactorily explained apparently very weak lines in RCW 86 (Rho et al.
    2002, Vink et al. 2006).

Some others to look at:

G1.9+0.3 (Reynolds et al. 2008b)

        Holy shit that thing is huge.  ~2 degrees in diameter!
        They kinda do the same thing, extract a bunch of profiles.
        but, they mainly apply results to cosmic ray acceleration from
        spectral analysis.

Now, how do I read the literature wisely?  Build an annotated bibliography again, of course.
