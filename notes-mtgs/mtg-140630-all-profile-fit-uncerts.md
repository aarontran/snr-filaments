2014 June 30 meeting
====================

* 1st: check SN 1006 regions.  Could also ask Satoru to try doing his fit
  routine on my profiles, but if I get consistent results for SN 1006 it'll
  probably be the same if he does it.
* 2nd: don't split regions anymore.  Try combining them, adding profiles
  together.  Suspicion (from lots of experience fitting stuff) is that even
  adding 2-3 regions, for a sqrt(3) improvement (i.e., factor of 2), will
  really help the error bars.  Just widen the regions as much as possible.

* Check against Chandra point spread function -- this is limited by the X-ray
  optics.  Use MAXI for this (will have to read documentation).  Line response
  function may be relevant?  Just to be sure...
* Check fits with total vs. average counts.  What I should do is save some fit
  numbers, w/ some default settings or whatever.
* Other papers on Tycho rims, who else has looked at this?

Some other things

* Give FWHM + uncerts, quantify difference between using 1-2 keV / 1-1.7 keV
  (eyeballing isn't enough `-__-`).  To show that it doesn't matter, and that
  the addition/subtraction of Si photons doesn't change profile shapes.

Update
------
See `rsch-notes.md`.  Large uncertainties were incorrectly calculated.
