Short meeting with Brian, afternoon of 2014 July 1
==================================================

Logistics
---------
* Email Sean and ask for the model + guide (no idea what language / how much
  time it will take to run the model and get results) (*done*)
* Email Brian/Rob, meet tomorrow.  Brian around all day. (*done*)
* Next SNR in line is Kepler -- this will need some processing (Brian had the
  files on hand for Tycho, but Kepler will take a day or so).  Think about this
  next week, perhaps.

Model fitting
-------------
* Brian generally favors the simple two exponential, and argues that the
  overshooting should be physically meaningful.  We can simply state -- here's
  what we did, here's what we tried.  Data is publically available, after all.
* Was there a motivation for Sean doing the band-to-band estimates of `$m_e$`?
  Couldn't remember if they said anything about how `$m_e$` changes with energy
* Try a global fit -- assume fixed `$m_e$` and fit the 4-5 points with a power
  law, see what happens (and, yes, try this between different models).  Do this
  by tomorrow and report.
* Check what went down in SN 1006 -- in each region was there a lot of
  variability?  Since they just averaged it all out and got 2 values for each
  filament.
