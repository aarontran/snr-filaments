CR, DSA papers
==============

* Bell, A. R., Schure, K. M., Reville, B., & Giacinti, G. (2013), Cosmic-ray acceleration and escape from supernova remnants, MNRAS
* Schure, K. M. & Bell, A. R. (2013) Cosmic ray acceleration in young supernova remnants, MNRAS

Cosmic ray (CR) escape triggers non-resonant hybrid (NRH) instability,
which amplifies B field and further confines CRs (self-regulating feedback)

Numerical model (MHD plasma, CR kinetics); 3-D simulations to get accurate turbulence
Predict that historical SNRs are accelerating CRs to ~0.1--0.2 PeV.
CR escape essential for high energy CRs (up to ~ PeV)

* Bykov, Ellison, Osipov, & Vladimirov 2014, B-field amplification in nonlinear DSA w/ resonant + non-resonant CR-driven instabilities, ApJ

Monte Carlo modeling... no idea what's going on.
The section at the end has a nice summary of recent DSA simulation efforts
They emphasize that they get more range / finer resolution in some aspect of parameter space,
vs., e.g., a 3-D MHD simulation (in which your life is just gonna suck)

* Ferrand, Decourchelle, Safi-Harb 2014, 3-D sim. of non-thermal broadband emission from young SNRS incl. efficient particle accel., ApJ

Hydrodynamic SNR simulation + kinetic simulation of particle accel.
Plot non-thermal synchrotron rims as function of age.
Predictions for e- inverse Compton scattering, pion decay from p+

* Ferrand, Danos, Shalchi, Safi-Harb, Edmon, Mendygral, 2014 CR accel. at perpendicular shocks in SNRs, ApJ

Lots of useful discussion...
