================================

Attached is main program (FullEfflength.f), which prompts the user for an input
of B_0, eta_2 (the Diffusion Coefficient in terms of the Bohm value at 2keV,
and mu.  It produces several files which contain radial profiles at different
photon energies, the FWHM at each photon energy, and a diagnostic file of the
electron distribution.  It requires fglists.dat to run. There are several
modifications you can make in terms of output.

I hope you know Fortran 77!  Unfortunately that's what my advisor knew at the
time and it's what everything is written in.  If you don't have a compiler
already, gfortran seems to works fine.

I'm sure you will have lots of questions as the code was written originally in
several bits and pieces and I wasn't expecting anyone else to have to use it,
so as soon as you have them, ask away!
