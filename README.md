Analysis of thin synchrotron emitting filaments in historical supernova
remnants.  Pipeline to generate and fit radial intensity profiles from Chandra
observations of Tycho's SNR.  Goal is to use energy dependence of filament
widths to constrain physical processes at SNR shocks -- namely, electron
diffusion and perhaps magnetic damping.

Work largely follows Ressler, Katsuda, Reynolds et al., ApJ, in press.,
preprint at arXiv:1406.3630.
