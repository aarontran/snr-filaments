\begin{abstract}
Many young supernova remnants exhibit thin X-ray bright rims of synchrotron
radiation at their forward shocks.  Thin rims are strong evidence for strong
magnetic field amplification, requiring shock-accelerated electrons to radiate
and cool rapidly downstream of the shock.  But, magnetic field damping
immediately behind the shock could produce similarly thin rims.  Synchrotron
loss-limited rim widths should decrease with energy whereas damping limited
rims should be relatively energy-independent.  To discriminate between models,
we measured rim widths around Tycho's supernova remnant in 5 energy bands using
an archival $750 \unit{ks}$ \Chandra observation.  Rims narrow with increasing
energy, favoring loss-limited radiation over magnetic damping and corroborating
similar observations in the remnant of SN 1006 (Ressler et al., 2014).
Observed widths are best fit by electron transport models requiring amplified
magnetic fields of $\abt200$--$1000 \unit{\mu G}$ and particle diffusion
coefficients $\abt 1$--$100\times$ Bohm values, consistent with prior work
on Tycho's SNR.  Non-negligible diffusion results in some degeneracy between
magnetic field strength and diffusion coefficient in setting observed rim
widths, but strong magnetic fields are required for all measurements.  A
different approach may be needed to better constrain diffusion at supernova
remnant shocks.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% Intro -- shocks, DSA, thin rims, filament observations; other fields/work
Forward shock accelerated electrons in young supernova remnants (SNRs) emit
synchrotron radiation strongly in the shock's immediate wake but quickly turn
off downstream, producing a shell-like morphology with bright X-ray and radio
rims/filaments due to line-of-sight projection \citep{koyama1995}.  Although
synchrotron emission due to accelerated electrons does not imply acceleration
of an unseen hadronic component, the prevailing theory of diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA) should operate on both protons and electrons.  Observations
of these synchrotron rims, with other lines of direct and indirect evidence,
have built a case for hadron and lepton acceleration up to $\unit{PeV}$
energies in young supernova remnants \citep{uchiyama2007, aharonian2004,
acero2010, ackermann2013} \note[Aaron]{up to PeV energies for both populations?
Do protons reach higher energies with lower synchrotron losses?}. Efficient
hadron acceleration, if able to convert $\abt10\%$ of a supernova's $10^{51}
\unit{erg}$, is a prime candidate source for galactic cosmic rays up to the CR
spectrum ``knee'' \citep{vink2012}.

Spectral and spatial measurements of synchrotron rims can help constrain
physical parameters of the shock acceleration process.  Many previous workers
have inferred strong magnetic field amplification at SNR shocks, as electrons
must radiate energy rapidly to account for the thinness of observed rims.
\note[Aaron]{flesh out} Plasma physics details -- Bell's cosmic ray current
instability \citep{bell2001} ties magnetic field amplification w/ maximum CR
energy (push towards and just above the PeV limit).  How to get large
compression ratios (why is 10 an upper bound suggested by Parizot), magnetic
fields -- how far can amplification go?
The processes observed in SNR shocks are broadly relevant to many collisionless
astrophysical shocks, such as Earth's bow shock, stellar wind-blown bubbles,
starburst galaxies \citep{heckman1990}, jets of active galactic nuclei, galaxy
clusters \citep{van-weeren2010}, and even cosmological shocks
\citep{miniati2000, ryu2008}.  Reviews of diffusive shock acceleration have
ably highlighted the ubiquity of shock acceleration in astrophysical settings
\note[Aaron]{too trite?} \citep[e.g.,][]{blandford1987, malkov2001}.

% What makes these shocks?
The widths of these X-ray rims are thought to be controlled by a combination of
synchrotron losses, particle transport, and magnetic fields immediately
downstream of the shock.  Synchrotron losses depend on the initial electron
energy distribution and the gradual decrease of electron energies downstream of
the shock.  High energy electrons near the shock efficiently radiate harder
synchrotron X-ray photons, but decline in energy as they are transported away
from the shock; this may be seen in spectral softening downstream of the shock
\citep[e.g.,][]{cassam-chenai2007}.  The transport process is driven by bulk
plasma advection downstream of the shock and particle diffusion with respect to
bulk advection.  In general, diffusion allows higher energy electrons to
diffuse further upstream or downstream than would be expected from pure
advection.  Finally, the magnetic field strength may be quickly damped behind
the shock, so that electrons may not radiate as efficiently and thin rims would
reflect the spatial structure of the field, rather than efficient particle
acceleration (and losses) and/or efficient synchrotron cooling
\citep{pohl2005}.

% Energy dependence.
Moreover, these controlling mechanisms predict different scalings for rim width
as a function of energy.  Synchrotron loss-limited rims should scale as $w
\propto \nu^{-1/2}$.  Diffusion smears out rims at all energies with stronger
effect at higher energies, yielding a slower drop-off in rim widths when
diffusion dominates.  Magnetic damping, if at a length scale comparable to
filament widths, predicts comparatively energy-independent rim widths --
intuitively, if the magnetic field turns off, synchrotron radiation turns off
regardless of electron energy.  \note[Aaron]{this would benefit from
numbers/quantification, I think this statement is stronger if the magnetic
field is stronger -- compare Figure 1 of \citet{pohl2005}} \citet{ressler2014}
give a much fuller exposition of the relative effects of advection, diffusion,
and magnetic field damping on filament rim widths.

% Which one is right?
Previous work has used the typical scale width of the filaments to derive
magnetic field estimates, among other physical parameters.  Observed
synchrotron spectrum roll-offs at X-ray energies require corresponding cut-offs
in the electron spectrum \citep{reynolds1998}; such a cut-off is naturally
predicted by DSA balanced against synchrotron losses, and requires that
diffusion and advection are both important near the electron cut-off energy
\note[Aaron]{imprecise statement...} Whether accounting for advection and
diffusion independently, or jointly in more sophisticated transport models, It
became clear that magnetic field amplification was necessary to explain the
observed filaments \citet{bamba2003, vink2003, parizot2006}.  \note[Aaron]{this
is said 3 paragraphs above already}

% Magnetic damping...
Magnetic damping immediately behind the shock offers a tantalizing alternative
explanation for filament rims that requires less extreme magnetic field
amplification, and damping has not been fully tested \citep{pohl2005,
marcowith2010}.  \citet{cassam-chenai2007} examined radio and X-ray synchrotron
rim profiles, but found that neither damping nor synchrotron losses matched
radio profiles particularly well.  \citet{araya2010} measured rims at multiple
energy bands in Cas A, but suggested that the rims only narrow more weakly than
expected and did not consider magnetic damping.  \citet{rettig2012} gave model
predictions for several historical SNRs and proposed discriminating based on
filament spectra -- the expectation is that damped spectra are softer,
loss-limited harder.  \citet{ressler2014}, using deep observations of SN 1006
from a recent \Chandra Large Project, fully developed the idea of
differentiating damping and loss-limited scenarios by using rim width energy
dependence and found rim narrowing in the remnant of SN 1006, strongly favoring
a loss-limited model.

% Why Tycho's SNR
To further test these models, we follow \citet{ressler2014} by measuring rim
widths at multiple energies in the remnant of Tycho's 1572 supernova
(hereafter, Tycho).  Tycho, being a nearby galactic SNR, is close enough that
its rims are well-resolved by \textit{Chandra}'s spatial resolution; the work
is further made possible by a deep $750 \unit{ks}$ exposure of the entire
remnant, yielding excellent count rates and allowing us to sample the rims
quite finely.  Tycho has an extensive and unusually contiguous shell of
synchrotron rims around its periphery, consistent with expansion into a low
density ISM.  \citet{williams2013} favor mean pre-shock ISM density $\abt
0.1$--$0.2 \unit{cm^{-3}}$, consistent with Tycho's X-ray expansion rate
\citep{katsuda2010}.  Although Tycho is expanding into an ISM gradient
\citep{williams2013} and interacting with a molecular cloud on its eastern limb
\citep{reynoso1999}, Tycho's spherical morphology suggests that we might expect
more consistent shock acceleration around its periphery than in other
historical remnants, whether of Type Ia or CC SNe.

Evidence for acceleration: spectral softening \citep{cassam-chenai2007}, CD-FS
gap \citep{warren2005}, multi-wavelength observations \citep{acero2010,
acciari2011, morlino2012} for SN 1006 and Tycho; Tycho's tiger stripes
\citep{eriksen2011}. These further support the notion that Tycho is actively
accelerating hadrons and leptons.
Various questions to consider (or answer).
Why the diversity of filament structure? How does diffusion really work?  How
much energy is going into cosmic rays / how efficient is the acceleration
process?  All sorts of things... (one interesting paper: \citet{caprioli2013}).
\note[Aaron]{this para may not be necessary}

% Paper roadmap
Our measurements and modeling closely followed and extended the procedure of
\citet{ressler2014} (hereafter, \citetalias{ressler2014}).  We first briefly
review relevant transport models which fully account for electron advection and
diffusion with continuous synchrotron losses, as considered by, e.g.,
\citet[and references therein]{berezhko2004} and \citet{rettig2012}.
We selected and measured rim widths at several locations around Tycho's forward
shock, verifying that selected rims are free of thermal line emission.  Using
our model for particle transport (with DSA included, to first order, in a
simple exponentially cut-off injected electron spectrum), we obtain estimates
on magnetic field strength and diffusion coefficient as a function. \emph{We
discuss the implications of our model fit results for particle transport in
Tycho, despite a significant degeneracy between diffusion and synchrotron
losses when diffusion is non-negligible.}

\section{Nonthermal rim modeling}\label{sec:models}

% TODO Chunk of text I don't know what to do with...
We consider two models for particle transport to our measurements of Tycho's
filament widths.  To best quantify width-energy dependence, we measure rim full
widths at half maximum (FWHMs) (Section~\ref{sec:fwhms}) and fit the
measurements to these models' predictions of rim FWHMs at multiple photon
energies.  \citetalias{ressler2014} give a fuller review of previous approaches
to characterizing filament widths, as well as a more thorough exposition of
model parameters and physical implications.

%Early workers measured filament widths of several historical supernova remnants
%and considered ...  Assuming that thin rim widths are limited by synchrotron
%energy losses (loss-limited rims), you have $l_{\mt{ad}} \propto v_d \tsynch$
%gives a magnetic field...  \citet{bamba2003, vink2003, yamazaki2004,
%ballet2006} More sophisticated models have followed, but the basic result is
%consistent -- magnetic fields are amplified, with some amount of diffusion.
%\citet{parizot2006, araya2010} consider diffusion and advection simultaneously
%with the catastrophic dump equation.  \citet{berezhko2003, berezhko2004,
%cassam-chenai2007, morlino2010, rettig2012} consider diffusion and advection
%simultaneously with the continuous loss equation instead.  DSA may be
%incorporated by direct calculation, or by assumption of a resultant electron
%spectrum and cut-off \citep[e.g.,][]{zirakashvili2007}.
%\citet{morlino2010}, and references therein, consider particle transport in the
%context of nonlinear DSA neglecting particle energy losses (as would be
%relevant for accelerated protons).  All the same principles.

\subsection{Particle transport}\label{sec:transport}

% TODO Choose names for these models and refer to them consistently, throughout
% TODO define ALL symbols, synchrotron constants, etc (somewhere state that CGS
%      notation is being used)
% TODO double check equations, exposition against Rettig/Pohl and others
% TODO review variable definitions when closer to final draft
\note[Aaron]{\citet{blandford1987} and other papers take a much more thorough
tack in deriving the relevant transport equations, drawing specifically from
plasma physics / DSA assumptions -- I suppose much material is not relevant or
condensed into our diffusion coefficient $D$ (w/ stated Bohm diffusion).
Is na\"ively citing generalized ``transport'' is sufficient here?
E.g., there is often a term of form $E/3 (\del\cdot\vec{v}) (\ptl f/\ptl E)$,
neglected for steady downstream velocity (i.e., $\del\cdot\vec{v}=0$), which
would not arise out of our equations as stated.
See, e.g., equation (9) of \citet{skilling1975}.}
% Transport fundamentals
The energy and space distribution of electrons at a supernova remnant
controls the synchrotron rims we see in X-ray and radio.  We model electron
transport from initial injection at the remnant's forward shock as following
an advection-diffusion equation given by:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\ptl f}{\ptl t} + \del \cdot \left( f \vec{v} \right)
  = C + \del \cdot \left( D \del f \right)
\end{equation}
where $f = f(E,x)$ is electron distribution as a function of electron energy
$E$ and downstream distance $x$ (where the forward shock is at $x=0$ and
$x>0$ towards the remnant's interior); $C$ is an arbitrary source/sink term,
$D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\vec{v}$ is a velocity field.
By considering 1-D steady-state plane transport at a constant downstream
velocity $v_d$ and a space-independent diffusion coefficient, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    v_d \frac{\ptl f}{\ptl x} - D \frac{\ptl^2 f}{\ptl x^2} = C .
\end{equation}
For simplicity, the source/sink term $C$ and diffusion coefficient $D$
encapsulate all assumptions about the DSA-generated electron spectrum, shock
and magnetic field structure, and time/space evolution of the particle
distribution.  We also consider only particle transport downstream of the
shock ($x \geq 0$).  More sophisticated treatments may explicitly treat
magnetic fields across the shock, plasma streaming instabilities and particle
losses, anisotropic diffusion, the DSA process and efficiency, and other
details in great depth \citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{reville2013,
bykov2014, ferrand2014}.

% Simple model
A first approximation is to let electrons have constant energy that is dumped
catastrophically after a synchrotron timescale $\tsynch = 1/(b B^2 E)$, where
$b = 1.57 \times 10^{-3}$ in CGS units and $B$ is magnetic field (which may
vary as $B=B(x)$).  The sink term is $C = -f / \tsynch$, yielding:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:simp-mod}
    v_d \frac{\ptl f}{\ptl x} - D \frac{\ptl^2 f}{\ptl x^2} +
    \frac{f}{\tau_{\mt{synch}}} = 0 .
\end{equation}
No assumptions on the injected electron source term are necessary
\note[Aaron]{I don't have a citation, but it seems simple enough?}.
\citet{parizot2006} employed this model to derive estimates of magnetic fields,
diffusion coefficients, and electron spectrum cut-offs for several historical
SNRs.  Conveniently, equation~\eqref{eq:simp-mod} has analytic solution $f
\propto \exp(-x/a)$ where $a$ is a characteristic scale length.  The thin rim
FWHM predicted by equation~\eqref{eq:simp-mod} is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:simp-fwhm}
    w = \frac{2\beta D / v_d}{\sqrt{1 +\frac{4D}{v_d^2 \tsynch}} - 1}
\end{equation}
with $\beta$ a projection factor relating $w$ to $a$ as $w = \beta a$
\citep{berezhko2004, parizot2006}.  We take $\beta = 4.6$ assuming a spatially
exponential $f(E,x)$ and projection from a spherical shell, as derived by
\citet{ballet2006}.

% Full model
A more accurate model accounts for continuous synchrotron losses as electrons
are injected from an exponentially cut-off power-law electron distribution
(normalization $K_0$, cut-off energy $\Ecut$) and transported downstream:
\begin{align} \label{eq:full-mod}
    v_d \frac{\ptl f}{\ptl x} - D \frac{\ptl^2 f}{\ptl x^2} =\;
    &K_0 E^{-s} e^{-E/\Ecut} \delta(x) \nonumber \\
    &+ \frac{\ptl}{\ptl E} \left(bB^2E^2f\right) ;
\end{align}
see \citet{berezhko2004, cassam-chenai2007, morlino2010, rettig2012}; and
references therein.  The cut-off energy is determined by the form of the
diffusion coefficient $D$, which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:diffcoeff}.
(but, cf. \citet{zirakashvili2007} on the exponential cut-off assumption) To
determine rim profiles and widths, we first numerically solve for electron
distribution $f(E,x)$ using Green's function solutions by \citet{lerche1980}
and \citet{rettig2012}; these solutions are given by \citetalias{ressler2014}
using notation similar to that used herein \note[Aaron]{wording}.  The electron
distribution may then be integrated to obtain synchrotron emissivity:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:emissivity}
    j_{\nu}(x) \propto \int_0^\infty G(y) f(E,x) dE
\end{equation}
where $y \equiv \nu/(c_1 E^2 B)$ is a scaled synchrotron frequency and
$G(y) = y \int_y^\infty K_{5/3}(z) dz$ is one-particle synchrotron emissivity
with $K_{5/3}(z)$ a modified Bessel function of the second kind
\citep{pacholczyk1970}.  Integrating emissivity over lines of sight for a
spherical remnant yields intensity as a function of radial coordinate $r$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:intensity}
    I_{\nu}(r) = 2 \int_0^{\sqrt{r_s^2 - r}}
                    j_{\nu} \left( r_s - \sqrt{s^2 + r^2} \right) ds
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the line-of-sight coordinate.  A model FWHM may then be calculated
from the resulting intensity profile.

In what follows we consider both transport models, but primarily present
results from the more advanced model (equation~\eqref{eq:full-mod}) as we find
the qualitative behavior of both models is comparable.

% Diffusion
\subsection{Diffusion energy-dependence} \label{sec:diffcoeff}

\note[Aaron]{can condense this, merge first 2 paragraphs here?}
The modus operandi of much previous work has been to assume Bohm diffusion or
diffusion-energy scaling ($D \propto E$).  Bohm diffusion assumes that the
particle mean free path $\lambda$ is equal to the gyroradius $r_g = E/(eB)$,
yielding diffusion coefficient $D_{\mt{B}} = \lambda c / 3 = c E / (3 e B)$.
We may generalize by adding a prefactor $\eta$ such that $\lambda = \eta r_g$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bohm}
    D = \frac{\lambda c}{3} = \frac{\eta c E}{3 e B} .
\end{equation}
Here, and throughout, we use CGS (Gaussian) units; $c$ is the speed of light,
$E$ is particle energy, $e$ is elementary charge, and $B$ is magnetic field.
Bohm diffusion at $\eta = 1$ is commonly considered a lower
limit on the diffusion coefficient at all energies, but sub-Bohm diffusion may be
possible in turbulently amplified oblique magnetic fields
\citep[e.g.,][]{reville2013}, and has not been well-studied.
\note[Aaron]{I have no justification, and minimal sense, of whether this is
correct or not.  Any treatment/discussion of Bohm diffusion?  All the papers
seem to take it for granted} Different types of MHD turbulence, in a
quasi-linear approximation for particle motion, may give rise to a non-linear
energy scaling for diffusion coefficient \citep{giacalone1999, reynolds2004}.
Power-wavenumber spectra for Kolmogorov and Kraichnan turbulence predict $D
\propto E^{1/3}$ and $D \propto E^{1/2}$ respectively.  For gyroradius larger
than field coherence length, $\mu = 2$ may be relevant as well.
\note[Aaron]{Source?? Parizot mentions this in one sentence and cites nothing}

In our models, we consider a generalized diffusion coefficient that with
arbitrary power-law dependence of diffusion upon energy:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:diffcoeff}
    D(E) = \frac{\eta C_d E^\mu}{B}
         = \eta_h D_{\mt{B}}\left(E_h\right) \left(\frac{E}{E_h}\right)^\mu .
\end{equation}
This follows, e.g., \citet{parizot2006}; note that $\eta$ now has units of
$\mathrm{erg}^{1-\mu}$.  In the right-hand side of
equation~\eqref{eq:diffcoeff} we also rescale the diffusion coefficient to its
value at a fiducial energy $E_h$, ; the now dimensionless $\eta_h$ is the
diffusion coefficient scaled to the Bohm value at $E_h$.  We choose fiducial
electron energy $E_h$ corresponding to a synchrotron photon energy of $2
\unit{keV}$, taking the $\delta$-function approximation that an electron of
energy $E$ radiates solely at frequency $\nu \propto E^2 B$ in a surrounding
magnetic field.  Then $E_h \propto \sqrt{2 \unit{keV} / B}$.  The value of
$E_h$ does depend on the user/model value of magnetic field $B$, but having
$\eta_h$ tied to observations at $2 \unit{keV}$ gives a convenient and
intuitive sense of diffusion strength when applied to any remnant.

With a diffusion coefficient in hand, we determine the electron spectrum
cut-off energy by equating synchrotron loss and diffusive acceleration
timescales.  For low energies, where synchrotron losses are small (cooling time
longer than acceleration time), electrons may be efficiently accelerated; near
or above the cut-off energy, electrons will radiate or escape too rapidly to be
accelerated, and so the energy spectrum drops off steeply.
The cut-off energy adapted from \citet{parizot2006} is given as:
\begin{align}
    \Ecut =
        &\left(8.3\unit{TeV}\right)^{2/(1+\mu)}
        \left(\frac{B_0}{100 \unit{\mu G}}\right)^{-1/(1+\mu)} \nonumber \\
        &\times \left(\frac{v_s}{10^8 \unit{cm\;s^{-1}}}\right)^{2/(1+\mu)}
        \eta^{-1 / (1+\mu)} .
\end{align}
Note that this expression implicitly assumes (1) a strong adiabatic shock with
compression ratio 4, and (2) isotropic magnetic turbulence both upstream and
downstream; see \citet{parizot2006} for a full derivation.


\subsection{Magnetic damping}

We also consider (not really) a magnetically damped field of form
\begin{equation}
    B(x) = B_{\mt{min}} + \left(B_0 + B_{\mt{min}}\right) \exp\left(-x / a_b\right) ,
\end{equation}
following \citet{pohl2005}.
In the full continuous energy loss model (equation~\eqref{eq:full-mod}), it
suffices to substitute $B = B(x)$ throughout; in the simpler model, $B(x)$
enters through the diffusion coefficient $D = D(E,x)$ and the analytic
expression (equation~\eqref{eq:simp-fwhm}) may no longer be valid.
Again, \citetalias{ressler2014} detail how to integrate a damped field into the
full model solutions.

(DRAFT) We currently do not present model fits with magnetic damping, although
in principle they are doable.  Set up the calculation w/ a range of scale
lengths (with $B_0$, $\eta_2$ chosen so that damping is the dominant control
for $0.7$--$7 \unit{keV}$), and compute FWHMs and $\mE$ values?

\subsection{Width-energy dependence}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, width-energy dependence is key to
differentiating between loss/diffusion-limited rims and magnetically damped
rims.  \citetalias{ressler2014} parameterize rim width-energy dependence in
terms of a scaling exponent $\mE$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
    w(\nu) \propto \nu^{\mE}
\end{equation}
where $w(\nu)$ is filament FWHM as a function of observed photon frequency
$\nu$. We do refer to observed photons interchangeably by energy or
frequency $\nu$; however, $E$ is reserved for electron energy.

Diffusion, for our purposes, is most important in weakening the energy
dependence of rim widths.  If both diffusion and magnetic field damping are
negligible, and electrons are only loss-limited as they advect downstream,
$\mE$ attains a minimum value $\mE = -0.5$ at all energies; this is the
strongest energy-dependence possible in our models.
Diffusion increases $\mE$ monotonically but roughly plateaus at values between
$-0.4$ and $0$, with larger $\mu$ values yielding weaker energy-dependence
($\mE$ closer to $0$, or even positive) \citepalias[Figure 3]{ressler2014}.

If magnetic damping is a primary control on rim widths, we expect to see $\mE
\sim -0.1$ \citepalias{ressler2014}.

\subsection{Previous studies of Tycho}

\note[Aaron]{Should we follow \citet{ressler2014} in adding a table of prior
magnetic field estimates? This could be placed here, in the intro, or in the
discussion.}
\citet{parizot2006} derive magnetic fields of $300$--$500 \unit{\mu G}$; they
also give both diffusion coefficients (in their $k_0$?) and $\Ecut$ values.
\citet{rettig2012} used a measured filament lengthscale and considered
loss-limited and magnetic damping models separately for several historical
SNRs.  For Tycho: they report $B = 310 \unit{\mu G}$ with $\Ecut = 24
\unit{TeV}$; since $\Ecut$ is set by balancing advective/diffusive
lengthscales, this is equivalent to our reporting of a diffusion coefficient
(?).  With magnetic damping, they report $B = 150 \unit{\mu G}$ and a larger
$\Ecut = 34 \unit{TeV}$.  Taken from \citet{rettig2012}: \citet{acciari2011}
give $80$, $230 \unit{\mu G}$ for leptonic/hadronic models for gamma-ray
emission in Tycho.

\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}

% NOTE go through and double check tenses.
We measured synchrotron rim full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) from an
archival \Chandra ACIS-I observation of Tycho
(RA: 00\tsup{h}25\tsup{m}19\fs0, dec: +64\arcdeg08\arcmin10\farcs0; J2000)
between 2009 Apr 11 and 2009 May 5 (PI: John P. Hughes;
\dataset[ADS/Sa.CXO\#obs/10093--10097]{ObsIDs: 10093--10097},
\dataset[ADS/Sa.CXO\#obs/10902--10906]{10902--10906}).
The total exposure time was $734 \unit{ks}$.
Level 1 \Chandra data were reprocessed with CIAO 4.6 and CALDB 4.6.1.1 and kept
unbinned with ACIS spatial resolution $0.492\arcsec$.
Merged and corrected events were divided into five energy bands:
0.7--1 keV, 1--1.7 keV, 2--3 keV, 3--4.5 keV, and 4.5--7 keV.
We excluded 1.7--2 keV energy range to avoid the \ion{Si}{13} (He$\alpha$)
emission line at 1.85 keV, prevalent in the remnant's thermal ejecta, which
\remove[Brian]{could} \remove[Aaron]{would} \add[Aaron]{may}
\note[Aaron]{since some profiles are practically uncontaminated?}
contaminate our nonthermal profile measurements.

We selected 13 regions in 5 distinct filaments around Tycho's shock
(Figure~\ref{fig:snr}) based on the following criteria: (1) filaments should be
clear of spatial plumes of thermal ejecta in \Chandra images, which rules out,
e.g., areas of strong thermal emission on Tycho's eastern limb; (2) filaments
should be singular and localized; multiple filaments should either not
overlap or completely overlap (rules out parts of NE limb); (3) filaments
should have clear FWHMs in most energy band; i.e., a peak should be evident
above the background signal or downstream thermal emission (rules out some
faint southern wisps) \note[Aaron]{wishy-washy qualitative}.  We grouped
regions into filaments by visual inspection of the remnant.

    \label{fig:snr}
\end{figure}

All measured rim widths are at least $\abt 1\arcsec$ and hence are resolved by
\textit{Chandra}'s point-spread function.
Looking at proposer's guide, Figure 4.13 -- the off-axis PSF should
still have FWHM of $\abt 1\arcsec$ at $4\arcmin$ (approx. Tycho's radius).
Is that good enough for us?
(\citet{cassam-chenai2007} considered PSF effects when modeling rim widths,
though it doesn't look like it made a big difference?) If the PSF matters, this
favors some combination of stronger magnetic fields and weaker diffusion.

\subsection{Filament spectra}
\label{sec:spec}

% NOTE be consistent in usage of word 'sections'
We extracted spectra for all regions to check that rim width measurements are
not affected by contaminating thermal line emission.  In each region, we
selected upstream and downstream sections from which to extract spectra.  The
upstream section is the smallest sub-region that contains the measured FWHM
bounds from all energy bands (see Section~\ref{sec:fwhms}); i.e., this region
captures the thin rim.  The downstream section extends from the back of the rim
(end of the upstream section) to the rim model fit's (equation~\eqref{eq:prof})
downstream limit.  We merged spectra from all \Chandra ObsIDs and grouped the
data into bins of $\geq 15$ counts.  Figure~\ref{fig:spec} plots an example
profile (4.5--7 keV) with the downstream and upstream sections highlighted; the
dividing line is set at the \textbf{???--???} energy band's downstream FWHM
limit here (see Figure~\ref{fig:profiles}).
We extracted background spectra from circular regions (radius $\abt 30\arcsec$)
around the remnant's exterior; each thin rim region was matched to the closest
background region's spectrum.
% Background region size is valid for data-tycho/bkg-2/ selections

% NOTE must match fig:profiles!  Keep region numbers updated and
% consistent.  Currently, region 1 of data-tycho/regions-4/ selections
\begin{figure*}
    \plotone{figures/fig-specs.pdf}
    \caption{Spectra and fits from Region 1. Left: $4.5$--$7 \unit{keV}$
    profile with highlighted downstream (blue) and upstream (grey) sections.
    Intensity units are arbitrary (a.u.).  Middle: downstream spectrum with
    absorbed power law fit; Si and S lines at $1.85$, $2.45 \unit{keV}$ are
    clearly visible.  Right: upstream spectrum with absorbed power law fit
    shows that the filament is likely free of thermal line emission.}
    \label{fig:spec}
\end{figure*}

We fit $0.5$--$7 \unit{keV}$ spectra from each region's upstream and downstream
sections to an absorbed power law model (XSPEC 12.8.1, \texttt{phabs*po}) with
spectral index $n$, hydrogen column density $n_H$, and a normalization as free
parameters.  Table~\ref{tab:spec} lists best fit parameters and reduced
$\chi^2$ values for all regions.  Spectra from thin rims (upstream sections)
are well-fit by the power law model alone; spectra from sections downstream of
the rims are generally poorly-fit, reflecting thermal contamination primarily
from \ion{Si}{13} and \ion{S}{15} He$\alpha$ line emission at $1.85$ and $2.45$
keV.  Although most downstream spectra show thermal contamination, some regions
(e.g., 4, 5 on Tycho's northwestern limb) are reasonably well-fit downstream by
an absorbed power law as well due to a larger distance between the forward
shock and contact discontinuity.
Upstream spectra fits spectral indices between $2.5$--$3$ are consistent with
synchrotron radiation spectra for a steep power-law electron distribution
\citep{vink2012}. Best fit column densities from
upstream spectra between $0.61$--$0.78 \times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$ are
consistent with previous fits to Tycho's nonthermal rims \citep{hwang2002} but
somewhat larger than $\abt0.35$--$0.5 \times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$ from radio
and optical??  HI absorption line measurements \citep{black1984, albinson1986,
kothes2004}.
% NOTE keep stated ranges of spectral indices, column densities up to date

% NOTE keep region numbers updated (in discussion of good/bad downstream spectra)

    \input{tab-spec.tex}
    \tablecomments{Absorbed power law fit parameters are photon index $\Gamma$
    and hydrogen column density $\mathrm{N_H}$.}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:spec} confirms that our region selections are practically free
of thermal line emission, as already suggested by visual inspection
(Figure~\ref{fig:snr}).  Our exclusion of all $1.7$--$2
\unit{keV}$ photons should further limit any thermal contamination, as
the $1.85 \unit{keV}$ Si line emission is over a third of Tycho's thermal flux
as detected by \Chandra \citep{hwang2002}.  We may safely proceed to model our
measured rim widths as being due entirely to nonthermal radiation
\note[Aaron]{bad phrasing}.

\subsection{Filament width measurements}
\label{sec:fwhms}

% NOTE keep mentioned number of regions updated!
% Update these numbers before final version.
We obtained radial intensity profiles from $\abt 10$--$20\arcsec$ behind the
shock to $\abt 2$--$8\arcsec$ in front for each of our 13 regions in all five
energy bands.  To increase signal-to-noise, we integrate along the shock ($\abt
8$--$24\arcsec$) in each region.  Plotted and fitted profiles are reported in
vignetting and exposure-corrected, but arbitrary, intensity units; error bars
are computed from raw count data assuming Poisson statistics.  Intensity
profiles peak sharply (within $\abt 2$--$3\arcsec$) behind the shock,
demarcating our thin rims, and then fall off until thermal emission from ejecta
picks up at Tycho's contact discontinuity \citep{warren2005}.

We fitted rim profiles, obtained by integrating intensity along the shock in
each region, to a piecewise two-exponential model:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prof}
    h(x) =
    \begin{cases}
        A_u \exp \left(\frac{x_0 - x}{w_u}\right) + C_u, &x \geq x_0 \\
        A_d \exp \left(\frac{x - x_0}{w_d}\right) + C_d, &x < x_0
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $h(x)$ is profile height and $x$ is radial distance from remnant center.
The rim model, which we emphasize is strictly empirical, has 6 free parameters:
$A_u, x_0, w_u, w_d, C_u$, and $C_d$ with $A_d = A_u + (C_u - C_d)$ enforcing
continuity at $x=x_0$. Our model is similar to that of \citet{bamba2003,
bamba2005-hist} and differs slightly from that of \citetalias{ressler2014}.
To fit only the nonthermal rim in each intensity profile, we selected the fit
domain for each profile as follows.  The downstream bound was set at the first
local data minimum downstream of the rim peak, as identified by smoothing the
profiles with a 21-point ($\abt 10\arcsec$) Hanning window.  The upstream bound
was set at the profile's outer edge (i.e., no data were removed).

\begin{figure*}[ht]
    \plotone{figures/fig-profiles.pdf}
    \caption{Best fit profiles with measured FWHMs demarcated for each energy
             band in Region 1.  Red data points are excluded from profile fit
             domain.}
    \label{fig:profiles}
\end{figure*}

% NOTE keep blacklisted/excluded region numbers updated!
From the fitted profiles we extracted a full width at half maximum (FWHM) for
each region and each energy band.  We could not resolve a FWHM in regions 2, 6,
and 8 at 0.7--1 keV (Table~\ref{tab:fwhms}); in these regions, either
the downstream FWHM bound would extend outside the fit domain or we could not
find an acceptable fit to equation~\eqref{eq:prof}.  We were able to resolve
FWHMs for all regions at higher energy bands (1--7 keV).
% NOTE review the FWHM rejection criterion, on the final set of regions

To estimate FWHM uncertainties, we horizontally stretched each best-fit
profile by mapping radial coordinate $x$ to
$x'(x) = x (1 + \xi (x-x_0)/(50\arcsec-x_0))$ with $\xi$ an arbitrary stretching
parameter and $x_0$ the best-fit rim center from equation~\eqref{eq:prof};
this yields a new profile $h'(x) = h(x'(x))$.
We varied $\xi$ (and hence rim FWHM) to vary each profile fit $\chi^2$ by 2.7
and the stretched or compressed FWHMs as upper/lower bounds on our reported
FWHMs. \note[Aaron]{Unimportant note: chi-squared values from our
fits assume that input errors are 1-sigma.  But, taking $\Delta\chi^2 = 1$
for our FWHM errors would shrink the errors even further, and the errors
don't reflect uncertainty that may arise from, e.g., using different fit
functions or taking different profiles.}


% -------------
% Model fitting
% -------------
\subsection{Filament model fitting}
\label{sec:fits}

% Fit data to models
We fit the two transport models given by Equations~\eqref{eq:simp-mod} and
\eqref{eq:full-mod} to our measured rim widths as a function of energy.
We assigned each width measurement to the lower energy limit of its energy band
(e.g., $0.7$--$1 \unit{keV}$ is assigned to $0.7 \unit{keV}$ and fitted to
model profile widths at $0.7 \unit{keV}$) \note[Aaron]{bad wording}.
We also averaged the positive and negative error bars on each FWHM measurement
(Table~\ref{tab:fwhms}) for least squares fitting.
% Averaging/merging/synthesizing, somehow, our results
Rim widths from each region are fitted separately; we consider filament and
remnant-wide physical parameters by averaging best fit parameters for each
region in Section~\ref{sec:fit-results}.

% Model knobs and how we twiddled them
We varied three physical parameters (more if we consider magnetic damping):
diffusion-energy scaling exponent $\mu$, normalized diffusion
coefficient $\eta_2$, and magnetic field strength $B_0$.
To make nonlinear fitting tractable, we fixed $\mu$ in all fits and considered
$\mu = 0$, $1/3$, $1/2$, $1$, $1.5$, and $2$;
recall that $\mu = 1/3$ and $1/2$ correspond to Kolmogorov and Kraichnan turbulence.
As $\eta_2$ is highly variable in our fits, we also performed
fits with $\eta_2 = 1$ fixed, coincident with Bohm diffusion at $2 \unit{keV}$.

A few remnant-specific parameters enter into the model calculations.  We take
electron spectral index $s = 2.3$ (from radio spectral index $\alpha = 0.65$,
\citet{kothes2006} \note[Aaron]{not using $0.58$ from Green's catalog?!}),
remnant distance $3 \unit{kpc}$ \citep[cf.][]{hayato2010}, and
shock radius $1.08 \times 10^{19} \unit{cm}$ from angular radius $240\arcsec$
\citep{green2009}.  Tycho's forward shock velocity varies with azimuth by up to
a factor of 2; we interpolated shock velocities reported by
\citet{williams2013} (rescaled to $3 \unit{kpc}$ rather than $2.3 \unit{kpc}$
to estimate individual shock velocities for each region.
\note[Aaron]{this paragraph might belong in an earlier section?}

% How to do the fit
Equation~\eqref{eq:simp-fwhm} was directly fit to our measurements to obtain
best-fit values of $\eta_2$ and $B_0$.
The full model was numerically computed as detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:transport}, yielding intensity profiles and hence model FWHMs
in each energy band; we then varied the input parameters ($\eta_2$, $B_0$) to
obtain a least squares best fit.
To assist the nonlinear fitting, we tabulated a large grid of model FWHM values
for various values of $\mu$ and shock velocity $v_s$; from a best initial grid
value, we then used a Levenberg-Marquardt fitting routine to determine the best
fits.
For both simple and full fits, we deemed fits with $\eta_2 \geq 10^5$ and $B_0
\geq 10 \unit{mG}$ effectively unconstrained; $\eta_2$ is also constrained to
be positive.

% TODO modify tables to match what is stated here -- in regards to parameters
% being effectively unbounded.
% TODO for extreme values in tables -- go back and double check chi^2 space
As the full model must be numerically solved, its predicted rim widths are
subject to resolution error in the numerical integrals.  We chose our
integration resolutions such that the fractional error in model FWHMs
associated with halving/doubling integration resolution is less than $1\%$ for
the parameter space relevant to our filaments.
\note[Aaron]{rewrite -- unclear.  Need to verify 1\% claim and check Pacholczyk
table resolution (and possibly Bessel function numbers)...}

% Errors
Finally, we computed errors on our best fit parameters by varying each
parameter and obtaining a new best fit model, with one less degree of freedom,
to find the parameter limit such that $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$ for a roughly
1-$\sigma$ error.

\section{Results}

% FWHM results, tables
% --------------------
\subsection{Rim widths}
\label{sec:fwhm-results}

In Table~\ref{tab:fwhms} we report FWHM measurements for all of our regions.
As previously noted, we could not resolve FWHMs for some regions in the 0.7--1
keV band.  We also report $\mE$ values for all but the lowest energy band,
computed point-to-point as: \begin{equation} \mE(E_2) =
\frac{\ln(w_2/w_1)}{\ln(E_2/E_1)} \end{equation} where $w_1, w_2$ and $E_1,
E_2$ are FWHMs and lower energy values for each energy band (e.g., $\mE$ at $1
\unit{keV}$ is computed using FWHMs from $0.7$--$1 \unit{keV}$ and $1$--$1.7
\unit{keV}$, and taking $E_2 = 1 \unit{keV}$ and $E_1 = 0.7 \unit{keV}$.
Although the values of $\mE$ reflect a good deal of variability in the
underlying width measurements, we see that most regions and energy bands
display a decrease in rim widths as a function of energy.  NOTE (draft): we
emphasize that $\mE$ is currently not considered or utilized in our subsequent
analysis.

\subsection{Model fit results}
\label{sec:fit-results}

% NOTE keep updated -- for which region are we giving simple and full fits?
We find that the simpler catastrophic dump model (equation~\eqref{eq:simp-mod})
produces the same qualitative trends seen in the full continuous energy loss
model.  The first row of Table~\ref{tab:fits} compares simple and full model
fits for Region 1 \note[Aaron]{data coming soon}.  In general, simple model
fits are less poorly constrained (i.e., fits are more likely to reach manual
fitting limits).  Where both simple and full model fits are well constrained
(i.e., moderate to small $\eta_2$ values), the simple model favors slightly
smaller $\eta_2$ and slightly larger $B_0$.  But this is not always true, and
it is difficult to identify any obvious trends as both fits are quite variable
across $\mu$ values and different regions.  \note[Aaron]{from the table
calculations, the simple model needed larger $B_0$ values than the full model
for a fixed $\eta_2$ and mean width (roughly speaking); this effect
strengthened with larger $\eta_2$.  We're looking at order 10--50\% effects}.
For the rest of our results and discussion, we consider only full model fits.

% Individual region fit results
Table~\ref{tab:fits} presents full model fit results for all regions
considered. Errors are computed by varying free parameters $B_0$,
$\eta_2$ to obtain $\Delta\chi^2 = 1$, corresponding to $1$-$\sigma$ confidence
limits on our fit parameters.
%In Figure~\ref{fig:fits-all} we also plot the best full model fits for the same

% Averaged fit results
In each filament, we averaged best fit parameters $B_0$, $\eta_2$ from each
constituent region to obtain filament-wide estimates on $B_0$ and $\eta_2$,
reported in Table~\ref{tab:fits-avg}.  Stated uncertainties are standard errors
of the mean \note[Aaron]{may need to scale by $\abt 2 \times$ to get 1-sigma
confidence interval since our sample sizes are so small}.  We note that both
averages and errors are strongly affected by outliers from extreme best fit
values, as can be seen in Tables~\ref{tab:fits} and \ref{tab:fits-pt2} --
especially as the typical number of regions per filament is quite small.

\subsection{Variations on a theme of plug \& chug}

Discuss, briefly, effects of twiddle-ables: changing Tycho distance ($2.3
\unit{kpc}$ to $4 \unit{kpc}$, see \citet{hayato2010}), compression ratio $r$,
accounting for azimuthal variation in $v_s$ (compare to taking a remnant
average?).  Sean already discussed $\Ecut$ (result: more high energy electrons
to damp out narrowing at high energy, if $\Ecut$ not included).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{How confidently can we reject B-damping?}

Everything hinges on our error bars -- this is most important.  Our rims do
thin consistently, in most regions (might be one or two places where they
don't), but (1) the errors in our individual FWHMs are larger than I'm
currently reporting because different profile fits will give a larger spread of
FWHMs (might need to consider reduced chi-squared here, but using chi-sqr to
select profile fit models is not physically meaningful)

It might be helpful to average $\mE$ values together, under the
assumption that they should be somewhat consistent within a given filament.
Then report the values and errors observed.  Again, needs more data points.

Recall that our FWHMs (Table~\ref{tab:fwhms}) have a large range of values,
IF magnetic damping is relevant in controlling filament widths, we might, e.g.,
expect a maximum filament width at which $\mE$ sharply levels off, being now
restricted by the magnetic field turn off.  We simply do not observe this in
our data between $0.7$--$7 \unit{keV}$.  We must conclude that, as in SN 1006
\citepalias{ressler2014}, magnetic damping cannot be relevant to our
observations.

What is the smallest damping scale length that is (roughly) consistent with all
of our observations?

X-ray rims are not damped -- could damping be relevant to the radio rims?

\subsection{Interpretation of fit parameters}

Magnetic field $B_0$: despite the large range of fit quality, we can give
fairly robust lower bounds.  Lowest bound (TBD)?  Consistent with previous
studies, Tycho requires strong magnetic field amplification -- up to ??? times
the expected value of $\abt 10 \unit{\mu G}$ from a strong adiabatic shock with
compression ratio $r=4$ and typical galactic magnetic field strength of $\abt
2$--$3 \unit{\mu G}$ \citep{lyne1989, han2006}.

Diffusion coefficient $\eta_2$, on the other hand, is a bit of a mess.
Would it be useful to report advective and diffusive lengthscales at 2 keV?
Idea being that it is hard to intuit what the large numbers even mean.
(especially for the simple model -- it sits on a plateau in chi-squared space
where small $\eta_2$ may be disfavored, but beyond a certain point any $\eta_2$
will do)

Can we favor a value of $\mu$ (and hence a turbulent energy spectrum)?

We could report estimates of cut-off energy?  I don't know if that is
helpful/meaningful for anything, unless we can tie it back to something in DSA.

\subsection{Bohm diffusion}

Fixing $\mu = 1$ and $\eta_2 = 1$ in Table~\ref{tab:fits-avg} is equivalent to
assuming Bohm diffusion, as most previous studies have done.
We should find/show that our result is very similar to theirs, in terms of
$B_0$ estimates, and this may be the easiest way to back out any estimates of
azimuthal magnetic field variation.

Magnetic field amplification numbers -- how do they compare with previous
studies?  What is the azimuthal variation (and significance thereof)?

Diffusion -- sub-Bohm diffusion in Filament 4?

\subsection{Other things}

Precursors, rim position variation (none obvious from preliminary look; see
Figure~\ref{fig:peak-pos}), steepness of the filament rise?

\section{Conclusions}

Our observations of filament thinning, although qualitative, are consistent
with the observations of \citet{ressler2014} in SN 1006.
We find that filaments narrow considerably.

Filaments widths, as might be expected, do not match model predictions too
consistently.  This may be attributed in part to spherical cow assumptions on
Tycho's nonthermal emission and shock structure, as well as its surrounding
medium.  This despite the fact that Tycho is the closest we have to a spherical
cow of a SNR!

We will follow up with an analysis of Kepler's supernova remnant and
Cassiopeia A \citep[see][]{araya2010}.  Further confirmation that X-ray rims
are not damped may suggest that any damping lengthscale must be quite a bit
larger than the observed rims, and the damping hypothesis will need to be
tested by continuing radio observations (???) or numerical and laboratory
simulations.

%\section{Additional calculations}
%
%Here I present full model fit results using FWHMs measured with an artificial
%cap imposed on the profile height, and the background $\min(C_u, C_d)$
%subtracted out before computing the FWHM.  The fitted profile may extend above
%the data maximum, but I find the full-width at one half of the data maximum.
%The results appear equivocal; there may be slightly smaller chi-squared values
%but it may not be statistically meaningful.
%
%I also present results for simple model fits, and fits for a larger set of
%regions (22 instead of 13).

%\section{Full model validation, SN 1006 (DRAFT ONLY)}
%
%For comparison to \citetalias{ressler2014}, we reproduce Sean's full model fit
%table (Table~\ref{tab:sean}) and present full model fits with 2 and 3 energy
%bands (Tables~\ref{tab:sn1006-2band} and \ref{tab:sn1006-3band}, respectively).
%We don't compare simple model results, as they are identical (only the error
%calculations differ).
%The procedures of Tables~\ref{tab:sean},~\ref{tab:sn1006-2band} are not quite
%the same.  Sean used $\mE$ at 2 keV instead of the $1$--$2$ keV width for
%fitting, whereas I used both widths.  But, it should not matter much as
%the fit often has $\chi^2 \sim 0$, either way (depending on the exact
%measurements and values of $\mu$).
%
%Please take the errors with a grain of salt.  They are automatically
%generated and \textbf{have not been manually validated}.  Some values may be
%invalid, where my error-finding code failed and gave a best, conservative guess
%of the error.
