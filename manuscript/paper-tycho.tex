\begin{abstract}
\note[Aaron]{Clone of AAS abstract}
Several young supernova remnants exhibit thin X-ray bright rims of synchrotron
radiation at their forward shocks.  Thin rims have been taken to indicate that
shock-accelerated electrons rapidly cool downstream of the shock, requiring
strong magnetic field amplification.  But, magnetic field damping immediately
behind the shock could produce similarly thin rims.  Synchrotron loss-limited
rim widths should decrease with energy whereas damping limited rims should be
relatively energy-independent.  To discriminate between models, we measured rim
widths around Tycho's supernova remnant in 5 energy bands using an archival
$750 \unit{ks}$ \Chandra observation.  Rims narrow with increasing energy,
favoring loss-limited radiation over magnetic damping and corroborating similar
observations in the remnant of SN 1006. Observed widths are best fit by
electron transport models requiring amplified magnetic fields of
$\abt200$--$1000 \unit{\mu G}$ and particle diffusion coefficients $\abt
1$--$100\times$ Bohm values, consistent with prior work on Tycho's SNR.
Non-negligible diffusion results in some degeneracy between magnetic field
strength and diffusion coefficient in setting observed rim widths, but strong
magnetic fields are required for all measurements.  A different approach may be
needed to better constrain diffusion at supernova remnant shocks.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% What are these shock rims, what is this acceleration?
Forward shock accelerated electrons in young supernova remnants (SNRs) emit
synchrotron radiation strongly in the shock's immediate wake but quickly turn
off downstream, producing a shell-like morphology with bright X-ray and radio
rims/filaments due to line-of-sight projection \citep{koyama1995}.  Although
synchrotron emission due to accelerated electrons does not imply acceleration
of an unseen hadronic component, the prevailing theory of diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA) should operate on both protons and electrons.  Observations
of these synchrotron rims, with other lines of direct and indirect evidence,
have built a case for hadron and lepton acceleration up to $\unit{PeV}$
energies in young supernova remnants \citep{uchiyama2007, aharonian2004,
acero2010, ackermann2013}.  Efficient hadron acceleration in supernova remnant
shocks is a prime candidate source for galactic cosmic rays up to the
cosmic ray spectrum's ``knee'' \citep{vink2012}.
\note[Aaron]{the discussion of hadronic acceleration isn't really relevant,
just background information}

% What can we learn from these shocks?  Why are they interesting?
Spectral and spatial measurements of synchrotron rims can constrain physical
parameters of the shock acceleration process.  Many previous workers have
inferred strong magnetic field amplification at SNR shocks, as electrons must
rapidly radiate energy to account for the thinness of observed rims
\citep{bamba2003, vink2003, parizot2006}.  Furthermore, broadband synchrotron
synchrotron flux from supernova remnants steepens at X-ray energies
\citep{reynolds1999}, corresponding to a cut-off in the underlying electron
spectrum as predicted by diffusive shock acceleration \citep{webb1984}.
\note[Aaron]{question: which came first?  observation of synchrotron
steepening, or explanation/prediction of electron cut-off and hence synchrotron
roll-off?  Or, even, was the electron cut-off predicted but the observable
consequence of synchrotron roll-off not recognized until observations?} Many
fundamental questions about the shock acceleration process remain to be
answered.  Under what conditions do shocks accelerate particles efficiently?
How are magnetic fields amplified in such shocks?  \citet{reynolds2008} reviews
relevant observations and open questions to date.  The answers to these
questions are broadly relevant to many astrophysical shocks, such as Earth's
bow shock, stellar wind-blown bubbles, starburst galaxies \citep{heckman1990},
jets of active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters \citep{van-weeren2010}, and
even cosmological shocks \citep{miniati2000, ryu2008}.
% Expand on these questions -- plasma turbulence, Alfven waves, wave damping
% behind the shock, upstream/downstream plasma interactions and instabilities
% These in turn affect plasma, CR dynamics -- how does the shock propagate and
% interact with the ISM?  Will we see a precursor due to diffusion and/or CR
% streaming?  How efficiently are CRs accelerated?

% What makes these shock rims?
The widths of these X-ray rims are controlled by a combination of
synchrotron losses, particle transport, and magnetic fields immediately
downstream of the shock.  Synchrotron losses depend on the initial electron
energy distribution and the gradual decrease of electron energies downstream of
the shock.  High energy electrons near the shock efficiently radiate harder
synchrotron X-ray photons, but decline in energy as they are transported away
from the shock; this may be seen in spectral softening downstream of the shock
\citep[e.g.,][]{cassam-chenai2007}.  The transport process is driven by bulk
plasma advection downstream of the shock and particle diffusion with respect to
bulk advection.  In general, diffusion allows higher energy electrons to
diffuse further upstream or downstream than would be expected from pure
advection.  Finally, the magnetic field strength may be quickly damped
downstream of the shock, so that electrons may not radiate as efficiently and
thin rims would reflect the spatial structure of the field, rather than
efficient particle acceleration (and losses) and/or efficient synchrotron
cooling \citep{pohl2005}.

% Whatever makes these shock rims also imposes energy dependence
Moreover, these controlling mechanisms predict different scalings for rim width
as a function of energy.  In the limiting case of constant magnetic field and
negligible particle diffusion, the rims are said to be synchrotron loss-limited
and rim widths should narrow with increasing photon frequency $\nu$ as
$\nu^{-1/2}$. Diffusion smears out rims at all energies with stronger effect at
higher energies, yielding a slower drop-off in rim widths when diffusion
dominates.  Magnetic damping, if at a length scale comparable to filament
widths, predicts comparatively energy-independent rim widths -- intuitively, if
the magnetic field turns off, synchrotron radiation turns off regardless of
electron energy.

% Magnetic damping?
Magnetic damping immediately behind the shock offers a tantalizing alternative
explanation for filament rims that requires less extreme magnetic field
amplification, and the possibility of damping in SNR shocks has not been fully
tested \citep{pohl2005, marcowith2010}.  \citet{cassam-chenai2007} examined
radio and X-ray synchrotron rim profiles, but found that neither damping nor
synchrotron losses matched radio profiles particularly well.  \citet{araya2010}
measured rims at multiple energy bands in Cas A, but suggested that the rims
only narrow more weakly than expected and did not consider magnetic damping.
\citet{rettig2012} gave model predictions for several historical SNRs and
proposed discriminating based on filament spectra -- the expectation is that
damped spectra are softer, loss-limited harder.  Recently, \citet{ressler2014}
further extended the idea of discriminating between damped or loss-limited
rims by measuring rim width energy dependence in X-ray energies and found that
rims consistently narrowed in the remnant of SN 1006, favoring synchrotron
loss-limited rims.

% Why Tycho's SNR
To further test these models, we follow \citet{ressler2014} (hereafter,
\citetalias{ressler2014}) by measuring rim widths at multiple energies in the
remnant of Tycho's 1572 supernova (hereafter, Tycho).  Tycho exhibits an
extensive shell of synchrotron-dominated thin rims around its periphery; the
rims show very little thermal emission, consistent with expansion into a low
density ISM \citet{williams2013}.  Tycho, being a nearby galactic SNR, is close
enough that its rims are easily resolved by \textit{Chandra} spatial
resolution. A deep $750 \unit{ks}$ exposure of the entire remnant from an
archived \Chandra large project (PI: J. Hughes) also allows us to sample the
remnant rims quite finely.  Furthermore, Tycho has been a prime target of study
for determining whether hadrons are being accelerated in historic SNRs
\citep[and references therein]{morlino2012}; understanding the acceleration
process will bear upon our understanding of CR acceleration in Tycho.
\note[Aaron]{reword/cut?}

% Paper roadmap
Our procedure closely follows that of \citetalias{ressler2014}.
We first briefly review relevant transport models which fully account for
electron advection and diffusion with continuous synchrotron losses, as
considered by, e.g., \citet[and references therein]{berezhko2004} and
\citet{rettig2012}.  We selected and measured rim widths at several locations
around Tycho's forward shock, verifying that selected rims are free of thermal
line emission.  Using our model for particle transport (with DSA included, to
first order, in a simple exponentially cut-off injected electron spectrum), we
obtain estimates on magnetic field strength and diffusion coefficient
magnitude. We discuss the implications of our model fit results for
particle transport in Tycho, despite a significant degeneracy between
diffusion and synchrotron losses when diffusion is non-negligible.

\section{Nonthermal rim modeling}\label{sec:models}

\note[Aaron]{I am a bit uncertain on the structure/order of presentation here,
particularly in presenting $\Ecut$ (which can be an independent observable?
but is not considered here).  I tried to put ``enough'' to independently
follow / re-derive all the model results.}
% TODO Chunk of text I don't know what to do with...
We consider two models for particle transport to our measurements of Tycho's
filament widths.  To best quantify width-energy dependence, we measure rim full
widths at half maximum (FWHMs) (Section~\ref{sec:fwhms}) and fit the
measurements to these models' predictions of rim FWHMs at multiple photon
energies.  \citetalias{ressler2014} give a fuller review of previous approaches
to characterizing filament widths, as well as a more thorough exposition of
model parameters and physical implications.

We use CGS (Gaussian) units throughout.

Any other introductory text -- emphasize that we back out two parameters,
possibly three or more.  COME BACK after writing magnetic damping bit.

%Early workers measured filament widths of several historical supernova remnants
%and considered ...  Assuming that thin rim widths are limited by synchrotron
%energy losses (loss-limited rims), you have $l_{\mt{ad}} \propto v_d \tsynch$
%gives a magnetic field...  \citet{bamba2003, vink2003, yamazaki2004,
%ballet2006} More sophisticated models have followed, but the basic result is
%consistent -- magnetic fields are amplified, with some amount of diffusion.
%\citet{parizot2006, araya2010} consider diffusion and advection simultaneously
%with the catastrophic dump equation.  \citet{berezhko2003, berezhko2004,
%cassam-chenai2007, morlino2010, rettig2012} consider diffusion and advection
%simultaneously with the continuous loss equation instead.  DSA may be
%incorporated by direct calculation, or by assumption of a resultant electron
%spectrum and cut-off \citep[e.g.,][]{zirakashvili2007}.
%\citet{morlino2010}, and references therein, consider particle transport in the
%context of nonlinear DSA neglecting particle energy losses (as would be
%relevant for accelerated protons).  All the same principles.

\subsection{Particle transport}\label{sec:transport}

% TODO Choose names for these models and refer to them consistently, throughout
% TODO define ALL symbols, synchrotron constants, etc (somewhere state that CGS
%      notation is being used)
% TODO double check equations, exposition against Rettig/Pohl and others
% TODO review variable definitions when closer to final draft
\note[Aaron]{\citet{blandford1987} and other papers take a much more thorough
tack in deriving the relevant transport equations, drawing specifically from
plasma physics / DSA assumptions -- I suppose much material is not relevant or
condensed into our diffusion coefficient $D$ (w/ stated Bohm diffusion).
Is na\"ively citing generalized ``transport'' is sufficient here?
E.g., there is often a term of form $(E/3) (\del\cdot\vec{v}) (\ptl f/\ptl E)$,
neglected for steady downstream velocity (i.e., $\del\cdot\vec{v}=0$), which
would not arise out of our equations as stated.
See, e.g., equation (9) of \citet{skilling1975}.}
% Transport fundamentals
The energy and space distribution of electrons at a supernova remnant
controls the synchrotron rims we see in X-ray and radio.  We model electron
advection and diffusion from initial injection at the remnant's forward shock
assuming 1-D steady-state plane transport, with spatially homogeneous and
isotropic diffusion, as following the equation:
\begin{equation}
    v_d \frac{\ptl f}{\ptl x} - D \frac{\ptl^2 f}{\ptl x^2} = C .
\end{equation}
Here $f = f(E,x)$ is electron distribution as a function of electron energy $E$
and downstream distance $x$ (where the forward shock is at $x=0$ and $x>0$
towards the remnant's interior); $C$ is an arbitrary source/sink term, $D$ is
the diffusion coefficient, and $v_d$ is plasma velocity downstream of the
shock.  We consider only particle transport downstream of the shock ($x \geq
0$).  The source/sink term $C$ and diffusion coefficient $D$ conveniently
encapsulate all assumptions about the accelerated electron spectrum, shock
and magnetic field structure, and time/space evolution of the particle
distribution.  More sophisticated treatments may explicitly treat magnetic
fields and diffusion across the shock, plasma streaming instabilities and
particle losses, anisotropic diffusion, the DSA process and efficiency, and
other details in great depth \citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{reville2013,
bykov2014, ferrand2014}.

% Simple model
A first approximation is to let electrons have constant energy that is dumped
catastrophically after a synchrotron timescale $\tsynch = 1/(b B^2 E)$, where
$b = 1.57 \times 10^{-3}$ in CGS units and $B$ is magnetic field (which may
vary in space as $B=B(x)$).  The sink term is $C = -f / \tsynch$, yielding:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:simp-mod}
    v_d \frac{\ptl f}{\ptl x} - D \frac{\ptl^2 f}{\ptl x^2} +
    \frac{f}{\tau_{\mt{synch}}} = 0 .
\end{equation}
No assumptions on the injected electron source term are necessary.
\citet{parizot2006} employed this model to derive estimates of magnetic fields,
diffusion coefficients, and electron spectrum cut-offs for several historical
SNRs.  Conveniently, equation~\eqref{eq:simp-mod} has analytic solution $f
\propto \exp(-x/a)$ where $a$ is a characteristic scale length.  The thin rim
FWHM predicted by equation~\eqref{eq:simp-mod} is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:simp-fwhm}
    w = \frac{2\beta D / v_d}{\sqrt{1 +\frac{4D}{v_d^2 \tsynch}} - 1}
\end{equation}
with $\beta$ a projection factor relating $w$ to $a$ as $w = \beta a$
\citep{berezhko2004, parizot2006}.  We take $\beta = 4.6$ assuming a spatially
exponential $f(E,x)$ and projection from a spherical shell, as derived by
\citet{ballet2006}.

% Full model
A more accurate model accounts for continuous synchrotron losses as electrons
are injected from an exponentially cut-off power-law electron distribution
(normalization $K_0$, cut-off energy $\Ecut$) and transported downstream:
\begin{align} \label{eq:full-mod}
    v_d \frac{\ptl f}{\ptl x} - D \frac{\ptl^2 f}{\ptl x^2} =\;
    &K_0 E^{-s} e^{-E/\Ecut} \delta(x) \nonumber \\
    &+ \frac{\ptl}{\ptl E} \left(bB^2E^2f\right) ;
\end{align}
see \citet{webb1984}, \citet{berezhko2004}, \citet{cassam-chenai2007},
\citet{morlino2010}, \citet{rettig2012}, and references therein.
\citet{zirakashvili2007} have derived a different electron spectrum with a
steeper $\exp\left(- \left(E/\Ecut\right)^2\right)$ cut-off, but we follow
\citetalias{ressler2014} in using $E^{-s} e^{-E/\Ecut}$ for conceptual
simplicity.  The cut-off energy is determined by the diffusion coefficient $D$,
which we address in Section~\ref{sec:diffcoeff}.  To determine rim profiles and
widths, we first numerically solve for electron distribution $f(E,x)$ using
Green's function solutions by \citet{lerche1980} and \citet{rettig2012}; these
solutions are given by \citetalias{ressler2014} using notation similar to that
used herein \note[Aaron]{wording}.  The electron distribution may then be
integrated to obtain synchrotron emissivity:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:emissivity}
    j_{\nu}(x) \propto \int_0^\infty G(y) f(E,x) dE
\end{equation}
where $y \equiv \nu/(c_1 E^2 B)$ is a scaled synchrotron frequency and
$G(y) = y \int_y^\infty K_{5/3}(z) dz$ is one-particle synchrotron emissivity
with $K_{5/3}(z)$ a modified Bessel function of the second kind
\citep{pacholczyk1970}.  Integrating emissivity over lines of sight for a
spherical remnant yields intensity as a function of radial coordinate $r$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:intensity}
    I_{\nu}(r) = 2 \int_0^{\sqrt{r_s^2 - r}}
                    j_{\nu} \left( r_s - \sqrt{s^2 + r^2} \right) ds
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the line-of-sight coordinate.  A model FWHM may then be calculated
from the resulting intensity profile.

% Moving on...
In what follows we consider both transport models, but primarily present
results from the more advanced model (equation~\eqref{eq:full-mod}) as we find
that the qualitative behavior of both models is comparable.

% Diffusion
\subsection{Diffusion energy-dependence} \label{sec:diffcoeff}

Much previous work has assumed Bohm-like diffusion in plasma downstream of the
shock.  Bohm diffusion assumes that the particle mean free path $\lambda$ is
equal to the gyroradius $r_g = E/(eB)$, yielding diffusion coefficient
$D_{\mt{B}} = \lambda c / 3 = c E / (3 e B)$; here $c$ is the speed of light,
$E$ is particle energy, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $B$ is magnetic
field.  Bohm-like diffusion introduces a free prefactor $\eta$ such that
$\lambda = \eta r_g$ allows for varying diffusion; however, Bohm diffusion at
$\eta = 1$ is commonly considered a lower limit on the diffusion coefficient at
all energies.
\note[Aaron]{for self-edification, any justification / derivation of this
result?  All the papers seem to take it for granted}
However, different types of MHD turbulence may give rise to a non-linear energy
scaling for diffusion coefficient \citep{giacalone1999, reynolds2004}.
Power-wavenumber spectra for Kolmogorov and Kraichnan turbulence, with a
quasi-linear approximation for particle motion,
\note[Aaron]{I don't really know what this means}
predict $D \propto E^{1/3}$ and $D \propto E^{1/2}$ respectively.
Particle gyroradii larger than field coherence length may to $D \propto E^{2}$
\note[Aaron]{Source?? Parizot mentions this in one sentence and cites nothing.
I have no idea what this means.}

In our models, we consider a generalized diffusion coefficient with arbitrary
power-law dependence upon energy following, e.g., \citet{parizot2006}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:diffcoeff}
    D(E) = \frac{\eta C_d E^\mu}{B}
         = \eta_h D_{\mt{B}}\left(E_h\right) \left(\frac{E}{E_h}\right)^\mu
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ parameterizes diffusion-energy scaling, and $\eta$ now has unites
of $\mathrm{erg}^{1-\mu}$.
The right-hand side of equation~\eqref{eq:diffcoeff} introduces a dimensionless
$\eta_h$ as the diffusion coefficient scaled to the Bohm value at a fiducial
particle energy $E_h$.  We subsequently choose the fiducial electron energy
$E_h$ corresponding to a synchrotron photon energy of $2 \unit{keV}$, taking
the $\delta$-function approximation that an electron of energy $E$ radiates
solely at frequency $\nu \propto E^2 B$ in a surrounding magnetic field.  Then,
$E_h \propto \sqrt{2 \unit{keV} / B}$.  Although the value of $E_h$ depends on
magnetic field $B$, tying $\eta_h$ to a fixed observation energy gives a
convenient and intuitive sense of diffusion strength regardless of the
electron energies producing observed rims.
\note[Aaron]{what I want to say: electron energies responsible for the rims we
see could vary between remnants or even within a single remnant.  And, we
cannot get a handle on diffusion at a singular electron energy or energy range,
in all our observations.  So it's simpler to tie $\eta_h$ to observation
energy.}

With a diffusion coefficient in hand, we determine the electron spectrum
cut-off energy by equating synchrotron loss and diffusive acceleration
timescales.  For low energies and small synchrotron losses (cooling time longer
than acceleration time), electrons may be efficiently accelerated; near or
above the cut-off energy, electrons will radiate or escape too rapidly to be
accelerated, so the energy spectrum drops off steeply.  The cut-off energy
adapted from \citet{parizot2006} is given as:
\begin{align}
    \Ecut =
        &\left(8.3\unit{TeV}\right)^{2/(1+\mu)}
        \left(\frac{B_0}{100 \unit{\mu G}}\right)^{-1/(1+\mu)} \nonumber \\
        &\times \left(\frac{v_s}{10^8 \unit{cm\;s^{-1}}}\right)^{2/(1+\mu)}
        \eta^{-1 / (1+\mu)} .
\end{align}
Note that this expression implicitly assumes (1) a strong shock with
compression ratio 4, and (2) isotropic magnetic turbulence both upstream and
downstream; see \citet{parizot2006} for a full derivation.

\subsection{Magnetic damping}

% TODO REVISIT THIS AFTER SETTING UP CALCULATIONS
We also consider (not really) a magnetically damped field of form
\begin{equation}
    B(x) = B_{\mt{min}} + \left(B_0 + B_{\mt{min}}\right) \exp\left(-x / a_b\right) ,
\end{equation}
following \citet{pohl2005}.
In the full continuous energy loss model (equation~\eqref{eq:full-mod}), it
suffices to substitute $B = B(x)$ throughout; in the simpler model, $B(x)$
enters through the diffusion coefficient $D = D(E,x)$ and the analytic
expression (equation~\eqref{eq:simp-fwhm}) may no longer be valid.
Again, \citetalias{ressler2014} detail how to integrate a damped field into the
full model solutions.

(DRAFT) We currently do not present model fits with magnetic damping, although
in principle they are doable.  Set up the calculation w/ a range of scale
lengths (with $B_0$, $\eta_2$ chosen so that damping is the dominant control
for $0.7$--$7 \unit{keV}$), and compute FWHMs and $\mE$ values?

\subsection{Width-energy dependence}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, width-energy dependence is key to
differentiating between loss/diffusion-limited rims and magnetically damped
rims.  \citetalias{ressler2014} parameterize rim width-energy dependence in
terms of a scaling exponent $\mE$ defined by:
\begin{equation}
    w(\nu) \propto \nu^{\mE}
\end{equation}
where $w(\nu)$ is filament FWHM as a function of observed photon frequency
$\nu$, and $\mE = \mE(\nu)$ is generally energy dependent.  We may refer to
observed photons interchangeably by energy or frequency $\nu$; however, $E$ is
reserved for electron energy.

If both diffusion and magnetic field damping are negligible (whether at a small
range of, or all, electron energies) and electrons are only loss-limited as
they advect downstream, $\mE$ attains a minimum value $\mE = -0.5$; this is the
strongest energy-dependence possible in our models.  Diffusion increases $\mE$
monotonically but roughly plateaus at values between $-0.4$ and $0$, with
larger $\mu$ values yielding weaker energy-dependence ($\mE$ closer to $0$, or
even positive) \citepalias[Figure 3]{ressler2014}.

% TODO REVISIT THIS AFTER SETTING UP CALCULATIONS
If magnetic damping is a primary control on rim widths, we expect to see $\mE
\sim -0.1$ \citepalias{ressler2014}.
\note[Aaron]{elaborate after filling in preceding section}

\subsection{Previous studies of Tycho}

\note[Aaron]{Should we follow \citet{ressler2014} in adding a table of prior
magnetic field estimates? This could be placed here, in the intro, or in the
discussion.}
\citet{parizot2006} derive magnetic fields of $300$--$500 \unit{\mu G}$; they
also give both diffusion coefficients (in their $k_0$?) and $\Ecut$ values.
\citet{rettig2012} used a measured filament lengthscale and considered
loss-limited and magnetic damping models separately for several historical
SNRs.  For Tycho: they report $B = 310 \unit{\mu G}$ with $\Ecut = 24
\unit{TeV}$; since $\Ecut$ is set by balancing advective/diffusive
lengthscales, this is equivalent to our reporting of a diffusion coefficient
(?).  With magnetic damping, they report $B = 150 \unit{\mu G}$ and a larger
$\Ecut = 34 \unit{TeV}$.  Taken from \citet{rettig2012}: \citet{acciari2011}
give $80$, $230 \unit{\mu G}$ for leptonic/hadronic models for gamma-ray
emission in Tycho.

\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}

% NOTE go through and double check tenses.
We measured synchrotron rim full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) from an
archival \Chandra ACIS-I observation of Tycho
(RA: 00\tsup{h}25\tsup{m}19\fs0, dec: +64\arcdeg08\arcmin10\farcs0; J2000)
between 2009 Apr 11 and 2009 May 5 (PI: J. Hughes;
\dataset[ADS/Sa.CXO\#obs/10093--10097]{ObsIDs: 10093--10097},
\dataset[ADS/Sa.CXO\#obs/10902--10906]{10902--10906}).
The total exposure time was $734 \unit{ks}$.
Level 1 \Chandra data were reprocessed with CIAO 4.6 and CALDB 4.6.1.1 and kept
unbinned with ACIS spatial resolution $0.492\arcsec$.
Merged and corrected events were divided into five energy bands:
0.7--1 keV, 1--1.7 keV, 2--3 keV, 3--4.5 keV, and 4.5--7 keV.
We excluded the 1.7--2 keV energy range to avoid any \ion{Si}{13} (He$\alpha$)
emission at 1.85 keV, prevalent in the remnant's thermal ejecta, which
might contaminate our nonthermal profile measurements.

% KEEP REGION NUMBER UPDATED
We selected 20 regions in 5 distinct filaments around Tycho's shock
(Figure~\ref{fig:snr}) based on the following criteria: (1) filaments should be
clear of spatial plumes of thermal ejecta in \Chandra images, which rules out,
e.g., areas of strong thermal emission on Tycho's eastern limb; (2) filaments
should be singular and localized; multiple filaments should either not
overlap or completely overlap (rules out parts of NE limb); (3) filament
peaks should be evident above the background signal or downstream thermal
emission (rules out faint southern filaments).  We accepted several
regions with poor quality peaks in the lowest energy band (0.7--1 keV) so long
as peaks in all higher energy bands were clear and well-fit.
\note[Aaron]{vague, imprecise}
We grouped regions into filaments by visual inspection of the remnant.
Within each filament, we chose region widths to obtain comparable counts
at the thin rim peak.
All measured rim widths are at least $1\arcsec$ and hence are resolved by
\textit{Chandra}'s point-spread function (PSF), which has FWHM of
$\abt 1\arcsec$ at $4\arcmin$ off-axis.

% TODO final figure should be higher quality, use vector overlay if possible

\subsection{Filament spectra}
\label{sec:spec}

% NOTE be consistent in usage of word 'sections'
We extracted spectra for all regions to check that rim width measurements are
not affected by contaminating thermal line emission.  In each region, we
selected upstream and downstream sections from which to extract spectra.  The
upstream section is the smallest sub-region that contains the measured FWHM
bounds from all energy bands (see Section~\ref{sec:fwhms}); i.e., this section
overlies the thin rim.  The downstream section extends from the back of the rim
(end of the upstream section) to the rim model fit's (equation~\eqref{eq:prof})
downstream limit.  We extracted spectra from all \Chandra ObsIDs and grouped
the data into bins of $\geq 15$ counts.  Figure~\ref{fig:spec} plots an example
profile ($4.54$--$7 \unit{keV}$) with the downstream and upstream sections
highlighted.  We extracted background spectra from circular regions (radius
$\abt 30\arcsec$) around the remnant's exterior; each thin rim region's spectra
subtracted the closest background region's spectrum.
% Background region size is valid for data-tycho/bkg-2/ selections

% NOTE must match fig:snr, fig:profiles!
% Keep region numbers updated and consistent.

    \caption{Spectra and fits from Regions 1 (top) and 16 (bottom) show varying

    line
emission.}
    \label{fig:spec}
\end{figure*}

We fit spectra from each region's upstream and downstream sections to an
absorbed power law model (XSPEC 12.8.1, \texttt{phabs*po}) between $0.5$--$7
\unit{keV}$ with photon index $\Gamma$, hydrogen column density $N_{\mt{H}}$,
and a normalization as free parameters.  Table~\ref{tab:spec} lists best fit
parameters and reduced $\chi^2$ values for all regions.  Spectra from thin rims
(upstream sections) are well-fit by the power law model alone; spectra from
sections downstream of the rims are generally poorly-fit, reflecting thermal
contamination primarily from \ion{Si}{13} and \ion{S}{15} He$\alpha$ line
emission at $1.85$ and $2.45$ keV.  Although most downstream spectra show
thermal contamination, some regions (e.g., ?!?!, ?!?! on Tycho's northwestern limb)
are reasonably well-fit downstream due to a larger gap between the forward
shock and contact discontinuity.
Our best-fit photon indices ($2.4$--$3$) and column densities ($0.6$--$0.8
\times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$) from upstream spectra are consistent with
previous spectral fits to Tycho's nonthermal rims \citep{hwang2002,
cassam-chenai2007}.

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:spec} confirms that our region selections are practically free
of thermal line emission, as already suggested by visual inspection
(Figure~\ref{fig:snr}).  Our exclusion of all $1.7$--$2 \unit{keV}$ photons
further limits thermal contamination as $1.85 \unit{keV}$ Si line emission is
over a third of Tycho's thermal flux as detected by \Chandra \citep{hwang2002}.

\subsection{Filament width measurements}
\label{sec:fwhms}

% NOTE keep mentioned number of regions updated!
% Check these (arcsec) numbers before final version.
We obtained radial intensity profiles from $\abt 10$--$20\arcsec$ behind the
shock to $\abt 5$--$10\arcsec$ in front for each of our regions in all five
energy bands.  To increase signal-to-noise, we integrate along the shock
($5$--$23\arcsec$) in each region.  Plotted and fitted profiles are reported in
vignetting and exposure-corrected intensity units; error bars are computed from
raw counts assuming Poisson statistics.  Intensity profiles peak sharply
within $\abt 2$--$3\arcsec$ behind the shock, demarcating our thin rims,
then fall off gradually until thermal emission picks up further behind the
shock.

We fitted rim profiles to a piecewise two-exponential model:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prof}
    h(x) =
    \begin{cases}
        A_u \exp \left(\frac{x_0 - x}{w_u}\right) + C_u, &x \geq x_0 \\
        A_d \exp \left(\frac{x - x_0}{w_d}\right) + C_d, &x < x_0
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $h(x)$ is profile height and $x$ is radial distance from remnant center.
The rim model, which is strictly empirical, has 6 free parameters:
$A_u, x_0, w_u, w_d, C_u$, and $C_d$; $A_d = A_u + (C_u - C_d)$ enforces
continuity at $x=x_0$. Our model is similar to that of \citet{bamba2003,
bamba2005-hist} and differs slightly from that of \citetalias{ressler2014}.
To fit only the nonthermal rim in each intensity profile, we selected the fit
domain for each profile as follows.  The downstream bound was set at the first
local data minimum downstream of the rim peak, identified by smoothing the
profiles with a 21-point ($\abt 10\arcsec$) Hanning window.  The upstream bound
was set at the profile's outer edge (i.e., no data were removed).

\begin{figure*}[ht]

    \caption{Best fit profiles with measured FWHMs demarcated for each energy
        band in Region 1 (top) and Region 16 (bottom).  Energy bands increase
        from left to right.  Data points in red were excluded from profile
        fitting domains as described in text.}
    \label{fig:profiles}
\end{figure*}

% NOTE keep blacklisted/excluded region count updated!
From the fitted profiles we extracted a full width at half maximum (FWHM) for
each region and each energy band after subtracting a constant background term
$\min(C_u, C_d)$.  We could not resolve a FWHM in 4 of 20 regions at 0.7--1 keV
(Table~\ref{tab:fwhms}); in these regions, either the downstream FWHM bound
would extend outside the fit domain or we could not find an acceptable fit to
equation~\eqref{eq:prof}.  We were able to resolve FWHMs for all regions at
higher energy bands (1--7 keV).
% NOTE review the FWHM rejection criterion, on the final set of regions
% We will be blacklisting by hand, and we have to explain how we chose the
% blacklisted ones.

To estimate FWHM uncertainties, we horizontally stretched each best-fit
profile by mapping radial coordinate $x$ to
$x'(x) = x (1 + \xi (x-x_0)/(50\arcsec-x_0))$ with $\xi$ an arbitrary stretching
parameter and $x_0$ the best-fit rim center from equation~\eqref{eq:prof};
this yields a new profile $h'(x) = h(x'(x))$.
We varied $\xi$ (and hence rim FWHM) to vary each profile fit $\chi^2$ by 2.7
and the stretched or compressed FWHMs as upper/lower bounds on our reported
FWHMs.

% Model fitting

\subsection{Filament model fitting}
\label{sec:fits}

% Fit data to models
We fit the two transport models given by Equations~\eqref{eq:simp-mod} and
\eqref{eq:full-mod} to our measured rim widths as a function of energy.
We mapped each width measurement to the lower energy limit of its energy band;
e.g., $0.7$--$1 \unit{keV}$ is assigned to $0.7 \unit{keV}$ and fitted to
model profile widths at $0.7 \unit{keV}$.  Errors in least squares fits
average the positive and negative errors on each FWHM measurement.

% Model knobs and how we twiddled them
We varied three physical parameters (more if we consider magnetic damping fits
explicitly):
diffusion-energy scaling exponent $\mu$, normalized diffusion
coefficient $\eta_2$, and magnetic field strength $B_0$.
To make nonlinear fitting tractable, we fixed $\mu$ in all fits and considered
$\mu = 0$, $1/3$, $1/2$, $1$, $1.5$, and $2$;
recall that $\mu = 1/3$ and $1/2$ correspond to Kolmogorov and Kraichnan turbulence.

% Tycho parameters
A few remnant-specific parameters enter into the model calculations.  We
adopted electron spectral index $s = 2.3$ from radio spectral index $\alpha = 0.65$
\note[Aaron]{will change to $s= 2.16$ from $\alpha=0.58$ following
\citet{sun2011} on next iteration}
\citep{kothes2006},
remnant distance $3 \unit{kpc}$ \citep[cf.][]{hayato2010}, and
shock radius $1.08 \times 10^{19} \unit{cm}$ from angular radius $240\arcsec$
\citep{green2009}.  Tycho's forward shock velocity varies with azimuth by up to
a factor of 2; we interpolated shock velocities reported by
\citet{williams2013} (rescaled to $3 \unit{kpc}$ rather than $2.3 \unit{kpc}$
to estimate individual shock velocities for each region.

% How to do the fit
Equation~\eqref{eq:simp-fwhm} was directly fit to our measurements to obtain
best-fit values of $\eta_2$ and $B_0$.  The full model was numerically computed
as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:transport}, yielding intensity profiles and
hence model FWHMs in each energy band.  To assist the nonlinear
fitting, we tabulated a large grid of model FWHM values for various values of
$\mu$, $\eta_2$, $B_0$, and shock velocity $v_s$.  From a best initial grid
value, we used a Levenberg-Marquardt fitting routine to determine the best
fits.  Errors on best fit parameters were computed by varying each fit
parameter and obtaining a new best fit model, with one less degree of freedom,
to find the parameter limit such that $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$ for a roughly
1-$\sigma$ error.

We required $\eta_2$ to be positive in all fits.  We also deemed
best-fit and error bound values with $\eta_2 \geq 10^5$ and $B_0 \geq 10
\unit{mG}$ to be effectively unconstrained. % Change this if needed.

% TODO Come back after checking Pacholczyk resolution
As the full model must be numerically solved, its predicted rim widths are
subject to resolution error in the numerical integrals (discretization over
radial coordinate, line-of-sight coordinate, electron distribution, Green's
function integrals).  We chose our integration resolutions such that the
fractional error in model FWHMs associated with halving/doubling integration
resolution is less than $1\%$ for the parameter space relevant to our
filaments.

\subsection{Rim widths}
\label{sec:fwhm-results}

Table~\ref{tab:fwhms} reports FWHM measurements for all of our regions.
We also report $\mE$ values for all but the lowest energy band, computed
point-to-point between discrete energy bands as:
\begin{equation}
    \mE(E_2) = \frac{\ln(w_2/w_1)}{\ln(E_2/E_1)}
\end{equation}
where $w_1, w_2$ and $E_1, E_2$ are FWHMs and lower energy values for each
energy band (e.g., $\mE$ at $1 \unit{keV}$ is computed using FWHMs from
$0.7$--$1 \unit{keV}$ and $1$--$1.7 \unit{keV}$, with $E_2 = 1
\unit{keV}$ and $E_1 = 0.7 \unit{keV}$.  Errors on $\mE$ are propagated in
quadrature from adjacent FWHM measurements.

\begin{table*}[ht]
    \scriptsize

    \caption{Measured full widths at half max (FWHMs) for all regions.
             \label{tab:fwhms}}
    \input{tab-fwhms.tex}
\end{table*}

Measured rim widths decrease with energy in most regions and energy bands.
Although the measurement variation between measurements is quite large, shown
dramatically in the point-wise computed $\mE$ values, the mean rim width
decreases consistently with increasing energy.  Furthermore, mean $\mE$ values
are consistently negative and tend smoothly towards $0$ (weaker
energy-dependence) with increasing energy.

The errors on FWHM measurements are typically $\abt 10\%$ or smaller,
reflecting the high quality of underlying \Chandra data as also seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:profiles}.  Scatter in FWHM measurements may be attributed in
part to (1) our profile fitting procedure, which depends on an empirically
chosen profile fit function which may also fit the rims non-uniquely, and (2)
variation in Tycho's rim morphology, also demonstrated clearly in
comparison of rims from Regions 1 and 16 in Figure~\ref{fig:profiles}.

% Individual region fit results
% NOTE keep updated -- for which region are we giving simple and full fits?
Table~\ref{tab:fits} presents full model fit results for all regions
considered.  The first row of Table~\ref{tab:fits} includes both simple and
full model fits for Region 1 for comparison.
We found that fits to the simpler catastrophic dump model
(equation~\eqref{eq:simp-mod}) reproduced qualitative trends seen in the full
continuous energy loss model, as expected.  In general, simple model fits
yielded slightly smaller $\eta_2$ and/or slightly larger $B_0$ values; this is
consistent with the expectation that electrons travel farther in the simple
model than in the full model, since electrons are not subjected to continuous
synchrotron cooling, so smaller $\eta_2$ and larger $B_0$ values are needed to
generate thinner rim widths as compared to the full model.  Simple model fits
were also more likely to reach manual fitting limits (i.e., allow for
unconstrained parameter values) than full model fits.

For the rest of our results and discussion, we consider only full model
fit results in Tycho for simplicity.  We do reference the simple model to build
intuition and give scaling relations, as was done in depth by
\citet{parizot2006} and \citetalias{ressler2014}.

% Averaged fit results
In each filament, we averaged best fit parameters $B_0$, $\eta_2$ from each
constituent region to obtain filament-wide estimates on $B_0$ and $\eta_2$,
reported in Table~\ref{tab:fits-avg}.  Stated uncertainties are standard errors
of the mean.  The averaged parameters and corresponding errors are strongly
affected by outliers from extreme best fit values, as can be seen in
Tables~\ref{tab:fits} and \ref{tab:fits-pt2} -- especially as the typical
number of regions per filament is quite small.  We also averaged best fit
parameters from all regions in the remnant, but the presence of outliers
renders the averages relatively unusable.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Energy dependence rules out magnetic damping for X-ray rims}

% Linchpin of argument -- energy dependence at ~1 keV incompatible with damping
% NOTE keep numbers up to date
Our observations of strong energy-dependence, particularly at low energies
(0.7--1 keV, 1--1.7 keV, 2--3 keV), are incompatible with magnetic damping as a
primary control on filament widths.
Our mean $\mE$ values with errors favor $|\mE| \gtrsim 0.25$ at $\abt 1
\unit{keV}$, and $|\mE| \gtrsim 0.19$ at $\abt 2 \unit{keV}$.
\note[Aaron]{calculations on magnetic damping $\mE$ go here}  % TODO FILL IN
\citetalias{ressler2014} also argued that magnetic damping generally requires
$|\mE| \sim 0.1$.  If thin rims are not magnetically damped at our lowest
energy bands, the rims will not be damped at any higher energies (barring
extreme $\mu>1$ diffusion with $\mE > 0$ that yields wider rims at higher
energies -- and indeed that is further disfavored by the electron energy
cut-off, as well as the fact that diffusion only begins to outpace advection
around the same cut-off).  Our result should hold for all photon energies above
$\abt 1 \unit{keV}$.

% More quantification -- give scale lengths, field strength values.
How robust is this result, give quantitative results.
What is the smallest damping scale length that is (roughly) consistent with all
of our observations?
\note[Aaron]{See Sean's section 3.2.1 and appendix for explication of the
magnetic damping disfavoring etc.}

% Address the broader trend in mE
The observed decrease in $|\mE|$ with increasing energy is attributable to
diffusion, which weakens width-energy dependence at higher energies
(even if diffusion is energy-independent with $\mu = 0$)
\citepalias[see][Figure 5]{ressler2014}.
\note[Aaron]{material on width scaling w/ $B_0$ and $\eta_2$. I'm not sure
where this should go, exactly.  May be better in the next section.
Or, this may even go in the beginning of the text, after or before introducing
transport models?!}
To make this more quantitative, note the scaling relations:
\begin{equation}
    l_{\mt{ad}} \propto v_d B_0^{-3/2} \nu^{-1/2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    l_{\mt{diff}} \propto \eta^{1/2} B_0^{-3/2} \nu^{(\mu-1)/4}
\end{equation}
As previously claimed, where advection dominates we expect $w \sim l_{\mt{ad}}
\sim \nu^{-1/2}$.  Where diffusion and advection are comparable, we expect
$|\mE|$ to decrease, i.e. yielding weaker energy dependence.
\citetalias{ressler2014} give a full discussion of the relative effects of
advection and diffusion, as well as the effect of $\Ecut$ in counterbalancing
the effects of diffusion at higher energies; see in particular Figures 3 and 5
of \citetalias{ressler2014}.  \note[Aaron]{might have been discussed earlier?}
The increasing importance of diffusion at X-ray energies matches the
synchrotron spectrum roll-off at X-ray energies as compared to radio
observations; the criterion for synchrotron roll-off, or electron cut-off, is
equivalent to requiring that advective and diffusive lengthscales are
comparable.  Thus, a weakening energy dependence in X-rays is consistent with
prior work and a welcome observation!
\note[Aaron]{I think this is a nice result of its own, unless it's a bit
obvious?  Importantly, the spectral roll-off observation is derived from the
intensity of Tycho -- how much flux comes out of the rims.  But we look at the
widths, disregarding intensity, and find a consistent result.}

% Addressing the variability in width measurements
The large variation in filament widths, and point-wise computed $\mE$ values,
does make our claim a little shakier.  Indeed, in Region 3 we see
\emph{increases} in filament width between multiple energy bands.
But we have confidence on our averaged results.
\note[Aaron]{We could also compute $\mE$ numerically from the model fit
profiles -- basically mimicking Sean's Figures 1, 5, 6, but generating $\mE$
numbers that effectively reflect the broad energy drop-off (or, lack thereof)
from all measured widths.}

\subsection{Model parameters: constraining magnetic fields and diffusion}

We now turn to our model fit parameters, magnetic field strength and diffusion
coefficient.

%WHERE to place the width - magnetic field dependence.  Cite Parizot's paper on
%this result, mention Sean's paper for symbols/set-up similar to our work.
%---> BRIAN reminded me, he wanted to talk about REMNANT DISTANCE. RIGHT.
%Throw this text in here, to discuss mE.
%Then we backreference this equation and simply say, the physical width scales
%linearly with the remnant distance.  The ONLY confounding factor is that shock
%velocity changes as well. -- SO, I need to add in NUMBERS!!!!!

% 1-2 paragraphs on this
Eta2 is poorly constrained.  Explain why -- we have a strong degeneracy between
magnetic field and eta2, especially at low mu.  Mention the sensitivity
results.
It is important to note that this is a limitation of our fitting model, not of
the data.  Stacking the data, e.g. by taking larger regions or averaging FWHM
measurements, does NOT help.

But, we note that our model fits generally favor $\eta_2 > 1$ -- the lowest
error bound on $\eta_2$ is ????. % TODO.

Magnetic field $B_0$: despite the large range of fit quality, we can give
fairly robust lower bounds.  Lowest bound is ????  Consistent with previous
studies, Tycho requires strong magnetic field amplification -- up to ??? times
the expected value of $\abt 10 \unit{\mu G}$ from a strong shock with
compression ratio $r=4$ and typical galactic magnetic field strength of $\abt
2$--$3 \unit{\mu G}$ \citep{lyne1989, han2006}.

A few ways to touch this -- can we back out information from the synchrotron
roll-off and hence $\Ecut$, to obtain diffusion coefficient independently of
$B_0$?  Then we have a single parameter fit.

We could report estimates of cut-off energy?  I don't know if that is
helpful/meaningful for anything, unless we can tie it back to something in DSA.

Can we favor a value of $\mu$ (and hence a turbulent energy spectrum)?


\subsection{Variations on a theme of plug \& chug}

Discuss, briefly, effects of twiddle-ables: changing Tycho distance ($2.3
\unit{kpc}$ to $4 \unit{kpc}$, see \citet{hayato2010}), compression ratio $r$,
accounting for azimuthal variation in $v_s$ (compare to taking a remnant
average?).  Sean already discussed $\Ecut$ (result: more high energy electrons
to damp out narrowing at high energy, if $\Ecut$ not included).

\subsection{Uncertainties what not trash heap}

% discussion of uncertainties/caveats in our results
Our FWHM measurements have a good deal of scatter.
One possible concern is our fitting function, which may overshoot or undershoot
our profiles, or simply fail to fit profiles that are not well-described as
having exponential fall-offs.
.. One way to address this is to consider other functions -- for example, a
gently smoothed spline fit, a manually capped two-exponential function, a
Gaussian sitting on a ramp or logistic curve, etc.
Explain that nothing happens -- not much (but I will reaffirm this).
.. another is simply our sampling -- we have already sought to circumvent this
by taking multiple regions in each filament, as many as possible without overly
compromising the quality of our radial profiles

\subsection{Other things}

Precursors, rim position variation (none obvious from preliminary look; see
Figure~\ref{fig:peak-pos}), steepness of the filament rise?

\section{Conclusions}

% Summarize our results
Our observations of filament thinning, although qualitative, are consistent
with the observations of \citet{ressler2014} in SN 1006.
We find that filaments narrow considerably.

Filaments widths, as might be expected, do not match model predictions too
consistently.  This may be attributed in part to spherical cow assumptions on
Tycho's nonthermal emission and shock structure, as well as its surrounding
medium.  This despite the fact that Tycho is the closest we have to a spherical
cow of a SNR!

% Further work -- radio
BROAD QUESTION -- Why couldn't we answer this from radio measurements?
Rims are splattered/lost in emission from within the remnant, looking at
\citet{cassam-chenai2007}.
Are the rims from shock accelerated electrons, simply swamped/drowned by
turbulence/synchrotron/bremsstrahlung in the interior? (seems that
bremsstrahlung is unimportant at very low frequencies...)

VLA data from Brian/Jack Hewitt, + Chandra X-ray data, coming November!
They have lots of fun things to look at -- proper motion (main thing),
polarization, etc.  Can take a look at the radio rims too and see what's up...

% Further work -- other SNRs
We will follow up with an analysis of Kepler's supernova remnant and
Cassiopeia A \citep[see][]{araya2010}.  Further confirmation that X-ray rims
are not damped may suggest that any damping lengthscale must be quite a bit
larger than the observed rims, and the damping hypothesis will need to be
tested by continuing radio observations (???) or numerical and laboratory
simulations.

Ask a theorist: if we find a pretty global behavior, that damping is disfavored
in all remnants -- what does that tell us about the damping?  Why
\emph{shouldn't} damping occur on small lengthscales?

%\section{Full model validation, SN 1006 (DRAFT ONLY)}
%
%For comparison to \citetalias{ressler2014}, we reproduce Sean's full model fit
%table (Table~\ref{tab:sean}) and present full model fits with 2 and 3 energy
%bands (Tables~\ref{tab:sn1006-2band} and \ref{tab:sn1006-3band}, respectively).
%We don't compare simple model results, as they are identical (only the error
%calculations differ).
%The procedures of Tables~\ref{tab:sean},~\ref{tab:sn1006-2band} are not quite
%the same.  Sean used $\mE$ at 2 keV instead of the $1$--$2$ keV width for
%fitting, whereas I used both widths.  But, it should not matter much as
%the fit often has $\chi^2 \sim 0$, either way (depending on the exact
%measurements and values of $\mu$).
%
%Please take the errors with a grain of salt.  They are automatically
%generated and \textbf{have not been manually validated}.  Some values may be
%invalid, where my error-finding code failed and gave a best, conservative guess
%of the error.
