	Abstract = {The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the related F-test, popularized in astrophysics by Eadie and coworkers in 1971, Bevington in 1969, Lampton, Margon, & Bowyer, in 1976, Cash in 1979, and Avni in 1978, do not (even asymptotically) adhere to their nominal chi2 and F-distributions in many statistical tests common in astrophysics, thereby casting many marginal line or source detections and nondetections into doubt. Although the above authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary to common practice, the nominal chi2 distribution for the LRT or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases of the inappropriate use of the LRT and similar tests in the literature, bringing substantive scientific results into question.},

	Abstract = {We show that the expansion of ejecta in Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) is consistent with a spherically symmetric shell, based on Suzaku measurements of the Doppler broadened X-ray emission lines. All of the strong Kalpha line emissions show broader widths at the center than at the rim, while the centroid energies are constant across the remnant (except for Ca). This is the pattern expected for Doppler broadening due to expansion of the SNR ejecta in a spherical shell. To determine the expansion velocities of the ejecta, we applied a model for each emission-line feature having two Gaussian components separately representing red- and blueshifted gas, and inferred the Doppler velocity difference between these two components directly from the fitted centroid energy difference. Taking into account the effect of projecting a three-dimensional shell to the plane of the detector, we derived average spherical expansion velocities independently for the Kalpha emission of Si, S, Ar, and Fe, and Kbeta of Si. We found that the expansion velocities of Si, S, and Ar ejecta of 4700 $\pm$ 100 km s-1 are distinctly higher than that obtained from Fe Kalpha emission, 4000 $\pm$ 300 km s-1, which is consistent with segregation of the Fe in the inner ejecta. Combining the observed ejecta velocities with the ejecta proper-motion measurements by Chandra, we derived a distance to Tycho's SNR of 4 $\pm$ 1 kpc.},

	Abstract = {Galaxy clusters form through a sequence of mergers of smaller galaxy clusters and groups. Models of diffusive shock acceleration suggest that in shocks that occur during cluster mergers, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, similar to conditions within supernova remnants. In the presence of magnetic fields, these particles emit synchrotron radiation and may form so-called radio relics. We detected a radio relic that displays highly aligned magnetic fields, a strong spectral index gradient, and a narrow relic width, giving a measure of the magnetic field in an unexplored site of the universe. Our observations show that diffusive shock acceleration also operates on scales much larger than in supernova remnants and that shocks in galaxy clusters are capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays.},

@article{ferrand2014,
	Abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to accelerate particles up to high energies through the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Except for direct plasma simulations, all modeling efforts must rely on a given form of the diffusion coefficient, a key parameter that embodies the interactions of energetic charged particles with the magnetic turbulence. The so-called Bohm limit is commonly employed. In this paper we revisit the question of acceleration at perpendicular shocks, by employing a realistic model of perpendicular diffusion. Our coefficient reduces to a power-law in momentum for low momenta (of index $\alpha$), but becomes independent of the particle momentum at high momenta (reaching a constant value $\kappa_{\infty}$ above some characteristic momentum $p_{\rm c}$). We first provide simple analytical expressions of the maximum momentum that can be reached at a given time with this coefficient. Then we perform time-dependent numerical simulations to investigate the shape of the particle distribution that can be obtained when the particle pressure back-reacts on the flow. We observe that, for a given index $\alpha$ and injection level, the shock modifications are similar for different possible values of $p_{\rm c}$, whereas the particle spectra differ markedly. Of particular interest, low values of $p_{\rm c}$ tend to remove the concavity once thought to be typical of non-linear DSA, and result in steep spectra, as required by recent high-energy observations of Galactic SNRs.},

@article{reynolds1999,
	Abstract = {Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are often assumed to be the source of cosmic rays up to energies approaching the slight steepening in the cosmic-ray spectrum at around 1000 TeV, known as the ``knee.'' We show that the observed X-ray emission of 14 radio-bright shell remnants, including all five historical shells, can be used to put limits on Emax, the energy at which the electron energy distribution must steepen from its slope at radio-emitting energies. Most of the remnants show thermal spectra, so any synchrotron component must fall below the observed X-ray fluxes. We obtain upper limits on Emax by considering the most rapid physically plausible cutoff in the relativistic electron distribution, an exponential, which is as sharp or sharper than found in any more elaborate models. This maximally curved model then gives us the highest possible Emax consistent with not exceeding observed X-rays. Our results are thus independent of particular models for the electron spectrum in SNRs. Assuming homogeneous emitting volumes with a constant magnetic field strength of 10 muG, no object could reach 1000 TeV, and only one, Kes 73, has an upper limit on Emax above 100 TeV. All the other remnants have limits at or below 80 TeV. Emax is probably set by the finite remnant lifetime rather than by synchrotron losses for remnants younger than a few thousand years, so that an observed electron steepening should be accompanied by steepening at the same energy for protons. More complicated, inhomogeneous models could allow higher values of Emax in parts of the remnant, but the emission-weighted average value, that characteristic of typical electrons, should obey these limits. The young remnants are not expected to improve much over their remaining lives at producing the highest energy Galactic cosmic rays; if they cannot, this picture of cosmic-ray origin may need major alteration.},

@article{vink2008,
	Abstract = {I have determined the expansion of the supernova remnant of SN 1604 (Kepler's supernova) based on archival Chandra ACIS-S observations made in 2000 and 2006. The measurements were done in several distinct energy bands, and were made for the remnant as a whole, and for six individual sectors. The average expansion parameter indicates that the remnant expands on average as r~t0.5, but there are significant differences in different parts of the remnant: the bright northwestern part expands as r~t0.35, whereas the rest of the remnant's expansion shows an expansion r~t0.6. The latter is consistent with an explosion in which the outer part of the ejecta has a negative power law slope for density (rho~v-n) of n=7, or with an exponential density profile [rho~exp(-v/ve)]. The expansion parameter in the southern region, in conjunction with the shock radius, indicates a rather low value (<5×1050 erg) for the explosion energy of SN 1604 for a distance of 4 kpc. A higher explosion energy is consistent with the results if the distance is larger. The filament in the eastern part of the remnant, which is dominated by X-ray synchrotron radiation, seems to mark a region with a fast shock speed r~t0.7, corresponding to a shock velocity of v=4200 km s-1, for a distance to SN 1604 of 4 kpc. This is consistent with the idea that X-ray synchrotron emission requires shock velocities in excess of ~2000 km s-1. The X-ray-based expansion measurements reported are consistent with results based on optical and radio measurements but disagree with previous X-ray measurements based on ROSAT and Einstein observations.},

@article{vink2003,
	Abstract = {We investigate the nonthermal X-ray emission from Cas A, using BeppoSAX, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory OSSE, and Chandra data. For the hard X-ray continuum we test the model proposed by Laming, which invokes nonthermal bremsstrahlung from electrons accelerated by lower hybrid plasma waves. The justification for this model comes from our determination of a lower limit to the average magnetic field of B>0.5 mG. For such high magnetic fields, the synchrotron losses are severe enough that most of the electron populations responsible for the radio emission have maximum electron energies well below the limit for which X-ray synchrotron emission is important. However, we do suggest that the rim surrounding Cas A, seen in Chandra continuum images, is X-ray synchrotron emission. The width of this rim of 1.5"-4" can be used to infer the magnetic field near the shock front, for which we estimate B=0.08-0.16 mG and electron energies of ~57-40 TeV. This magnetic field strength is lower than the average magnetic field but higher than what may be expected from shocked interstellar medium, suggesting either a high magnetic field in the wind of the progenitor or rapid postshock field amplification by nonlinear growth of plasma waves. Combining the two magnetic field measurements, we have constructed a simple two-zone model. Most of the radio emission comes from inside Cas A, where the magnetic field is strong. In contrast, the inverse Compton emission is dominated by emission from near the shock front. Only for our lower limit on the magnetic field strength near the shock front is it possible to explain the recent detection of TeV emission by the High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy experiment with inverse Compton emission, for which, in addition, we have to assume a rather high far-infrared photon density that should be twice as high as our best estimate of ~70 cm-3. Pion decay is therefore likely to be the dominant emission from Cas A at TeV energies.},

@article{volk2005,
	Abstract = {It is shown that amplification of the magnetic field in supernova remnants (SNRs) occurs in all six objects where morphological measurements are presently available in the hard X-ray continuum at several keV. For the three archetypical objects (SN 1006, Cas A and Tycho's SNR) to which nonlinear time-dependent acceleration theory has been successfully applied up to now, the global theoretical and the local observational field strengths agree very well, suggesting in addition that all young SNRs exhibit the amplification effect as a result of very efficient acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays (CRs) at the outer shock. Since this appears to be empirically the case, we may reverse the argument and consider field amplification as a measure of nuclear CR acceleration and it has indeed been argued that acceleration in the amplified fields allows the CR spectrum from SNRs to reach the knee in the spectrum or, in special objects, even beyond. The above results are furthermore used to investigate the time evolution of field amplification in young SNRs. Although the uncertainties in the data do not allow precise conclusions regarding this point, they rather clearly show that the ratio of the magnetic field energy density and the kinetic energy density of gas flow into the shock is of the order of a few percent if the shock speed is high enough V_s>103 km s-1, and this ratio remains nearly constant during the SNR evolution. The escape of the highest energy nuclear particles from their sources becomes progressively important with age, reducing also the cutoff in the pi^0-decay gamma-ray emission spectrum with time after the end of the sweep-up phase. Simultaneously the leptonic gamma-ray channels will gain in relative importance with increasing age of the sources.},

	Abstract = {We present 3.6-160 mum infrared images of Kepler's supernova remnant (SN 1604) obtained with the IRAC and MIPS instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We also present MIPS SED low-resolution spectra in the 55-95 mum region. The observed emission in the MIPS 24 mum band shows the entire shell. Emission in the MIPS 70 mum and IRAC 8 mum bands is seen only from the brightest regions of 24 mum emission, which also correspond to the regions seen in optical Halpha images. Shorter wavelength IRAC images are increasingly dominated by stars, although faint filaments are discernible. The SED spectrum of shows a faint continuum dropping off to longer wavelengths and confirms that strong line emission does not dominate the mid-IR spectral region. The emission we see is due primarily to warm dust emission from dust heated by the primary blast wave; no excess infrared emission is observed in regions where supernova ejecta are seen in X-rays. We use models of the dust to interpret the observed 70/24 mum ratio and constrain the allowed range of temperatures and densities. We estimate the current mass of dust in the warm dust component to be 5.4×10-4 Msolar, and infer an original mass of about 3×10-3 Msolar before grain sputtering. The MIPS 160 mum band shows no emission belonging to the remnant. We place a conservative but temperature-dependent upper limit on any cold dust component roughly a factor of 10 below the cold dust mass inferred from SCUBA observations. Finally, we comment on issues relevant to the possible precursor star and the supernova type.  Based on observations made with the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope.

	Abstract = {Characterization of the relatively poorly understood progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae is of great importance in astrophysics, particularly given the important cosmological role that these supernovae play. Kepler's supernova remnant, the result of a Type Ia supernova, shows evidence for an interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), suggesting a single-degenerate progenitor system. We present 7.5-38 mum infrared (IR) spectra of the remnant, obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, dominated by emission from warm dust. Broad spectral features at 10 and 18 mum, consistent with various silicate particles, are seen throughout. These silicates were likely formed in the stellar outflow from the progenitor system during the asymptotic giant branch stage of evolution, and imply an oxygen-rich chemistry. In addition to silicate dust, a second component, possibly carbonaceous dust, is necessary to account for the short-wavelength Infrared Spectrograph and Infrared Array Camera data. This could imply a mixed chemistry in the atmosphere of the progenitor system. However, non-spherical metallic iron inclusions within silicate grains provide an alternative solution. Models of collisionally heated dust emission from fast shocks (>1000 km s-1) propagating into the CSM can reproduce the majority of the emission associated with non-radiative filaments, where dust temperatures are ~80-100 K, but fail to account for the highest temperatures detected, in excess of 150 K. We find that slower shocks (a few hundred km s-1) into moderate density material (n 0 ~ 50-250 cm-3) are the only viable source of heating for this hottest dust. We confirm the finding of an overall density gradient, with densities in the north being an order of magnitude greater than those in the south.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the observability, by direct and indirect means, of a shock precursor arising from magnetic field amplification by cosmic rays. We estimate the depth of such a precursor under conditions of nonresonant amplification, which can provide magnetic field strengths comparable to those inferred for supernova remnants. Magnetic field generation occurs as the streaming cosmic rays induce a plasma return current, and it may be quenched by either nonresonant or resonant channels. In the case of nonresonant saturation, the cosmic rays become magnetized and amplification saturates at higher magnetic fields. The precursor can extend out to 1017-1018 cm and is potentially detectable. If resonant saturation occurs, the cosmic rays are scattered by turbulence and the precursor length will likely be much smaller. The dependence of precursor length on shock velocity has implications for electron heating. In the case of resonant saturation, this dependence is similar to that in the more familiar resonantly generated shock precursor, which when expressed in terms of the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient kappav and shock velocity vs is kappav/vs . In the nonresonantly saturated case, the precursor length declines less quickly with increasing vs . Where precursor length proportional to 1/vs gives constant electron heating, this increased precursor length could be expected to lead to higher electron temperatures for nonresonant amplification. This should be expected at faster supernova remnant shocks than studied by previous works. Existing results and new data analysis of SN 1006 and Cas A suggest some observational support for this idea.},

	Abstract = {We examine the structure of the postshock region in supernova remnants (SNRs). The ``shock transition zone'' is set up by charge transfer and ionization events between atoms and ions and has a width ~(1015 cm-2)n-10, where n0 is the total preshock density (including both atoms and ions). For Balmer-dominated SNRs with shock velocity vs>~1000 km s-1, the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for ion velocity and temperature are obeyed instantly, leaving the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the broad Halpha line versus vs relation intact. However, the spatial variation in the postshock densities is relevant to the problem of Lyalpha resonant scattering in young, core-collapse SNRs. Both two- (preshock atoms and ions) and three-component (preshock atoms, broad neutrals, and ions) models are considered. We compute the spatial emissivities of the broad (xib) and narrow (xin) Halpha lines; a calculation of these emissivities in SN 1006 is in general agreement with the computed ones of Raymond and coworkers. The (dimensionless) spatial shift, Thetashift, between the centroids of xib and xin is unique for a given shock velocity and fion, the preshock ion fraction. Measurements of Thetashift can be used to constrain n0.},

	Abstract = {We derive the preshock density and scale length along the line of sight for the collisionless shock from a deep HST image that resolves the Halpha filament in SN 1006 and updated model calculations. The very deep ACS high-resolution image of the Balmer line filament in the northwest quadrant shows that 0.25 cm-3<=n0<=0.4 cm-3 and that the scale along the line of sight is about 2×1018 cm, while bright features within the filament correspond to ripples with radii of curvature less than 1/10 that size. The derived densities are within the broad range of earlier density estimates, and they agree well with the ionization timescale derived from the Chandra X-ray spectrum of a region just behind the optical filament. This provides a test for widely used models of the X-ray emission from SNR shocks. The scale and amplitude of the ripples are consistent with expectations for a shock propagating through interstellar gas with ~20% density fluctuations on parsec scales as expected from studies of interstellar turbulence. One bulge in the filament corresponds to a knot of ejecta overtaking the blast wave, however. The interaction results from the rapid deceleration of the blast wave as it encounters an interstellar cloud.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a deep (670 ks) X-ray survey of the entire SN 1006 remnant from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, together with a deep Halpha image of SN 1006 from the 4 m Blanco telescope at CTIO. Comparison with Chandra images from 2003 gives the first measurement of the X-ray proper motions around the entire periphery, carried out over a 9 yr baseline. We find that the expansion velocity varies significantly with azimuth. The highest velocity of ~7400 km s-1 (almost 2.5 times that in the northwest (NW)) is found along the southeast (SE) periphery, where both the kinematics and the spectra indicate that most of the X-ray emission stems from ejecta that have been decelerated little, if at all. Asymmetries in the distribution of ejecta are seen on a variety of spatial scales. Si-rich ejecta are especially prominent in the SE quadrant, while O and Mg are more uniformly distributed, indicating large-scale asymmetries arising from the explosion itself. Neon emission is strongest in a sharp filament just behind the primary shock along the NW rim, where the pre-shock density is highest. Here the Ne is likely interstellar, while Ne within the shell may include a contribution from ejecta. Within the interior of the projected shell we find a few isolated "bullets" of what appear to be supernova ejecta that are immediately preceded by bowshocks seen in Halpha, features that we interpret as ejecta knots that have reached relatively dense regions of the surrounding interstellar medium, but that appear in the interior in projection. Recent three-dimensional hydrodynamic models for Type Ia supernovae display small-scale features that strongly resemble the ones seen in X-rays in SN 1006 an origin in the explosion itself or from subsequent hydrodynamic instabilities both remain viable options. We have expanded the search for precursor X-ray emission ahead of a synchrotron-dominated shock front, as expected from diffusive shock acceleration theory, to numerous regions along both the northeast and southwest rims of the shell. Our data require that a precursor be thinner than about 3'', and fainter than about 5% of the post-shock peak. These limits suggest that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of seven or more in a narrow precursor region, promoting diffusive particle acceleration.  Based on observations made with NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under contract # NAS83060; the data were obtained through program GO1-12115.},

	Abstract = {We report results of infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of the SN 1006 remnant, carried out with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The 24 mum image from Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer clearly shows faint filamentary emission along the northwest rim of the remnant shell, nearly coincident with the Balmer filaments that delineate the present position of the expanding shock. The 24 mum emission traces the Balmer filaments almost perfectly but lies a few arcsec within, indicating an origin in interstellar dust heated by the shock. Subsequent decline in the IR behind the shock is presumably due largely to grain destruction through sputtering. The emission drops far more rapidly than current models predict, however, even for a higher proportion of small grains than would be found closer to the Galactic plane. The rapid drop may result in part from a grain density that has always been lower---a relic effect from an earlier epoch when the shock was encountering a lower density---but higher grain destruction rates still seem to be required. Spectra from three positions along the NW filament from the Infrared Spectrometer instrument all show only a featureless continuum, consistent with thermal emission from warm dust. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in the pre-shock interstellar medium (ISM) is lower than that expected for the Galactic ISM---as has also been observed in the analysis of IR emission from other supernova remnants, but whose cause remains unclear. As with other Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remnants, SN 1006 shows no evidence for dust grain formation in the SN ejecta.},

	Abstract = {Spitzer images of Tycho's supernova remnant in the mid-infrared reveal limb-brightened emission from the entire periphery of the shell and faint filamentary structures in the interior. As with other young remnants, this emission is produced by dust grains, warmed to ~100 K in the post-shock environment by collisions with energetic electrons and ions. The ratio of the 70 to 24 mum fluxes is a diagnostic of the dust temperature, which in turn is a sensitive function of the plasma density. We find significant variations in the 70/24 flux ratio around the periphery of Tycho's forward shock, implying order-of-magnitude variations in density. While some of these are likely localized interactions with dense clumps of the interstellar medium (ISM), we find an overall gradient in the ambient density surrounding Tycho, with densities 3-10 times higher in the northeast than in the southwest. This large density gradient is qualitatively consistent with the variations in the proper motion of the shock observed in radio and X-ray studies. Overall, the mean ISM density around Tycho is quite low (~0.1-0.2 cm-3), consistent with the lack of thermal X-ray emission observed at the forward shock. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Type Ia supernova expanding into a density gradient in the ISM, and find that the overall round shape of the remnant is still easily achievable, even for explosions into significant gradients. However, this leads to an offset of the center of the explosion from the geometric center of the remnant of up to 20%, although lower values of 10% are preferred. The best match with hydrodynamical simulations is achieved if Tycho is located at a large (3-4 kpc) distance in a medium with a mean preshock density of ~0.2 cm-3. Such preshock densities are obtained for highly (gsim 50%) porous ISM grains.},

	Abstract = {We explore the relationship between the models for progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae and the properties of the supernova remnants that evolve after the explosion. Most models for Type Ia progenitors in the single-degenerate scenario predict substantial outflows during the presupernova evolution. Expanding on previous work, we estimate the imprint of these outflows on the structure of the circumstellar medium at the time of the supernova explosion, and the effect that this modified circumstellar medium has on the evolution of the ensuing supernova remnant. We compare our simulations with the observational properties of known Type Ia supernova remnants in the Galaxy (Kepler, Tycho, SN 1006), the Large Magellanic Cloud (0509-67.5, 0519-69.0, N103B), and M31 (SN 1885). We find that optically thick outflows from the white dwarf surface (sometimes known as ``accretion winds'') with velocities above 200 km s-1 excavate large low-density cavities around the progenitors. Such large cavities are incompatible with the dynamics of the forward shock and the X-ray emission from the shocked ejecta in all the Type Ia remnants that we have examined.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we use high-quality X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra to gain new insights into the explosion that originated Tycho's supernova 433 yr ago. We perform a detailed comparison between the ejecta emission from the spatially integrated X-ray spectrum of the supernova remnant and current models for Type Ia supernova explosions. We use a grid of synthetic X-ray spectra based on hydrodynamic models of the evolution of the supernova remnant and nonequilibrium ionization calculations for the state of the shocked plasma. We find that the fundamental properties of the X-ray emission in Tycho are well reproduced by a one-dimensional delayed detonation model with a kinetic energy of ~1.2×1051 ergs. All the other paradigms for Type Ia explosions that we have tested, including one-dimensional deflagrations, pulsating delayed detonations, and sub-Chandrasekhar explosions, as well as deflagration models calculated in three dimensions, fail to provide a good approximation of the observed ejecta emission. Our results require that the supernova ejecta retain some degree of chemical stratification, with Fe peak elements interior to intermediate-mass elements. This strongly suggests that a supersonic burning front (i.e., a detonation) must be involved at some stage in the physics of Type Ia supernova explosions.},

	Abstract = {The explosion mechanism behind Type Ia supernovae is a matter of continuing debate. The diverse attempts to identify or at least constrain the physical processes involved in the explosion have been only partially successful so far. In this paper we propose to use the thermal X-ray emission from young supernova remnants (SNRs) originating in Type Ia events to extract relevant information concerning the explosions themselves. We have produced a grid of thermonuclear supernova models representative of the paradigms currently under debate: pure deflagrations, delayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations, and sub-Chandrasekhar explosions, using their density and chemical composition profiles to simulate the interaction with the surrounding ambient medium and the ensuing plasma heating, nonequilibrium ionization and thermal X-ray emission of the ejecta. Key observational parameters such as electron temperatures, emission measures, and ionization timescales are presented and discussed. We find that not only is it possible to identify the explosion mechanism from the spectra of young Type Ia SNRs, it is in fact necessary to take the detailed ejecta structure into account if such spectra are to be modeled in a self-consistent way. Neither element line flux ratios nor element emission measures are good estimates of the true ratios of ejected masses, with differences of as much as 2 or 3 orders of magnitude for a given model. Comparison with observations of the Tycho SNR suggests a delayed detonation as the most probable explosion mechanism. Line strengths, line ratios, and the centroid of the Fe Kalpha line are reasonably well reproduced by a model of this kind.},

	Abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been assumed to be the source of cosmic rays (CRs) up to the "knee" of the CR spectrum at 1015 eV, accelerating particles to relativistic energies in their blast waves by the process of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Since CR nuclei do not radiate efficiently, their presence must be inferred indirectly. Previous theoretical calculations and X-ray observations show that CR acceleration significantly modifies the structure of the SNR and greatly amplifies the interstellar magnetic field. We present new, deep X-ray observations of the remnant of Tycho's supernova (SN 1572, henceforth Tycho), which reveal a previously unknown, strikingly ordered pattern of non-thermal high-emissivity stripes in the projected interior of the remnant, with spacing that corresponds to the gyroradii of 1014-1015 eV protons. Spectroscopy of the stripes shows the plasma to be highly turbulent on the (smaller) scale of the Larmor radii of TeV energy electrons. Models of the shock amplification of magnetic fields produce structure on the scale of the gyroradius of the highest energy CRs present, but they do not predict the highly ordered pattern we observe. We interpret the stripes as evidence for acceleration of particles to near the knee of the CR spectrum in regions of enhanced magnetic turbulence, while the observed highly ordered pattern of these features provides a new challenge to models of DSA.},

	Abstract = {Although collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, certain key aspects of them are not well understood. In particular, the process known as collisionless electron heating, whereby electrons are rapidly energized at the shock front, is one of the main open issues in shock physics. Here, we present the first clear evidence for efficient collisionless electron heating at the reverse shock of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), revealed by Fe K diagnostics using high-quality X-ray data obtained by the Suzaku satellite. We detect Kbeta (3p --> 1s) fluorescence emission from low-ionization Fe ejecta excited by energetic thermal electrons at the reverse shock front, which peaks at a smaller radius than Fe Kalpha (2p --> 1s) emission dominated by a relatively highly ionized component. Comparisons with our hydrodynamical simulations imply instantaneous electron heating to a temperature 1000 times higher than expected from Coulomb collisions alone. The unique environment of the reverse shock, which is propagating with a high Mach number into rarefied ejecta with a low magnetic field strength, puts strong constraints on the physical mechanism responsible for this heating and favors a cross-shock potential created by charge deflection at the shock front. Our sensitive observation also reveals that the reverse shock radius of this SNR is about 10% smaller than the previous measurement using the Fe Kalpha morphology from the Chandra observations. Since strong Fe Kbeta fluorescence is expected only from low-ionization plasma where Fe ions still have many 3p electrons, this feature is key to diagnosing the plasma state and distribution of the immediate postshock ejecta in a young SNR.},

We find that the proper motion of the edge of the remnant (i.e., the forward shock and protruding ejecta knots) varies from 0farcs20 yr-1 (expansion index m = 0.33, where R = tm ) to 0farcs40 yr-1 (m = 0.65) with azimuthal angle in 2000-2007 measurements, and 0farcs14 yr-1 (m = 0.26) to 0farcs40 yr-1 (m = 0.65) in 2003-2007 measurements. The azimuthal variation of the proper motion and the average expansion index of ~0.5 are consistent with those derived from radio observations. We also find proper motion and expansion index of the reverse-shocked ejecta to be 0farcs21-0farcs31 yr-1 and 0.43-0.64, respectively. From a comparison of the measured m-value with Type Ia supernova evolutionary models, we find a pre-shock ambient density around the remnant of lsim0.2 cm-3.},

	Abstract = {We present evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration at the forward shock in Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) from three X-ray observables: (1) the proximity of the contact discontinuity to the forward shock, or blast wave, (2) the morphology of the emission from the rim of Tycho, and (3) the spectral nature of the rim emission. We determine the locations of the blast wave (BW), contact discontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) around the rim of Tycho's supernova remnant using a principal component analysis and other methods applied to new Chandra data. The azimuthal-angle-averaged radius of the BW is 251". For the CD and RS we find average radii of 241" and 183", respectively. Taking account of projection effects, we find ratios of 1:0.93:0.70 (BW:CD:RS). We show these values to be inconsistent with adiabatic hydrodynamic models of SNR evolution. The CD:BW ratio can be explained if cosmic-ray acceleration of ions is occurring at the forward shock. The RS:BW ratio, as well as the strong Fe Kalpha emission from the Tycho ejecta, imply that the RS is not accelerating cosmic rays. We also extract radial profiles from ~34% of the rim of Tycho and compare them to models of surface brightness profiles behind the BW for a purely thermal plasma with an adiabatic shock. The observed morphology of the rim is much more strongly peaked than predicted by the model, indicating that such thermal emission is implausible here. Spectral analysis also implies that the rim emission is nonthermal in nature, lending further support to the idea that Tycho's forward shock is accelerating cosmic rays.},

	Abstract = {The outer shells of young supernova remnants (SNRs) are the most plausible acceleration sites of high-energy electrons with the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. We studied spatial and spectral properties close to the shock fronts in four historical SNRs (Cas A, Kepler's remnant, Tycho's remnant, and RCW 86) with excellent spatial resolution of Chandra. In all of the SNRs, hard X-ray emissions were found on the rims of the SNRs, which concentrate in very narrow regions (so-called filaments); apparent scale widths on the upstream side are below or on the order of the point-spread function of Chandra, while they are 0.5"-40" (0.01-0.4 pc) on the downstream side with most reliable distances. The spectra of these filaments can be fitted with both thermal and nonthermal (power law and SRCUT) models. The former requires unrealistic high temperature (>~2 keV) and low abundances (<~1 solar) for emission from young SNRs and may be thus unlikely. The latter reproduces the spectra with best-fit photon indices of 2.1-3.8, or roll-off frequencies of (0.1-28)×1017 Hz, which reminds us of the synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated via DSA. We consider various physical parameters as functions of the SNR age, including the previous results on SN 1006; the filament width on the downstream side increases with the SNR age, and the spectrum becomes softer, keeping a nonthermal feature. It was also found that a function, that is, the roll-off frequency divided by the square of the scale width on the downstream side, shows negative correlation with the age, which might provide us some information on the DSA theory.},

	Abstract = {We report optical spectroscopy and imaging of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) which suggest that two different precursors are associated with the blast wave. In long-slit spectra of the eastern rim, we find diffuse Halpha emission extending >~1' ahead of Knot g, a bright nonradiative shock propagating at velocity ~2000 km s-1. In addition to the hydrogen lines, the diffuse spectrum also exhibits [S II] lambdalambda6716, 6731; [N II] lambda6583 and weak [O III] lambda5007 emission. Narrowband imagery of Tycho's SNR shows that the diffuse emission extends ahead of most of the Balmer-dominated optical filaments and drops sharply in the remnant interior, suggesting that the diffuse gas is overrun by the supernova shock. The line ratios of the diffuse gas are compared with predictions from a simple He II lambda304 photoionization precursor model. The models predict that the radiative transfer of He II lambda304 photons in the precursor produces spatially distinct ionization layers of H0, He0-He+, N0-N++, O0-O++, and S+-S+3 ahead of the shock. The models suggest that the diffuse emission arises from collisional excitation in mostly neutral gas which has been heated to a temperature ~12,000 K. In high-resolution echelle spectra of Knot g, we find that the narrow Halpha component is broadened to 44+/-4 km s-1, suggesting that the upstream gas may be further heated before it crosses the shock, perhaps by a fast neutral or cosmic-ray precursor. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Halpha line in both the diffuse region and Knot g will be required to definitively establish the existence of a second precursor.},

To explain the observed scale lengths, we construct two simple models with a test particle approximation, where the maximum energy of accelerated electrons is determined by the age of SN 1006 (age-limited model) or the energy loss (energy loss-limited model), and constrain the magnetic field configuration and the diffusion coefficients of accelerated electrons. When the magnetic field is nearly parallel to the shock normal, the magnetic field should be in the range of 20-85 muG and highly turbulent both upstream and downstream, which means that the mean free path of accelerated electrons is of the order of their gyro-radius (Bohm limit). This situation can be realized both in the age-limited and energy loss-limited model. On the other hand, when the magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the shock normal, which can exist only in the age-limited case, the magnetic field is several muG upstream and 14-20 muG downstream, and the upstream magnetic field is less turbulent than the downstream.},

@article{reynolds1998,
	Abstract = {The diffusive shock acceleration process can accelerate particles to a maximum energy depending on the shock speed and age and on any competing loss processes on the particles. The shock waves of young supernova remnants can easily accelerate electrons to energies in excess of 1 TeV, where they can produce X-rays by the synchrotron process. I describe a detailed calculation of the morphology and spectrum of synchrotron X-rays from supernova remnants. Remnants are assumed to be spherical and in the Sedov evolutionary phase, though the results are insensitive to the detailed dynamics. The upstream magnetic field is assumed uniform; downstream it is assumed to be compressed but not additionally turbulently amplified. In all cases, spectra begin to depart from power laws somewhere in the optical to UV range and roll off smoothly through the X-ray band. I show that simple approximations for the electron emissivity are not adequate; a full convolution of the individual electron synchrotron emissivity with a calculated electron distribution at each point in the remnant is required. Models limited by the finite shock age, by synchrotron or inverse Compton losses on electrons, or by escape of electrons above some energy have characteristically different spectral shapes, but within each class, models resemble one another strongly and can be related by simple scalings. The images and spectra depend primarily on the remnant age, the upstream magnetic field strength, and the level of magnetic turbulence near the shock in which the electrons scatter. In addition, images depend on the viewing or aspect angle between the upstream magnetic field and the line of sight. The diffusion coefficient is assumed to be proportional to particle energy (or mean free path proportional to gyroradius), but I investigate the possibility that the proportionality constant becomes much larger above some energy, corresponding to an absence of long-wavelength MHD waves. Models producing similar spectra may differ significantly in morphology, which allows for possible discriminations. I parameterize the model spectra in terms of a slope at 4 keV and a factor by which the X-ray flux density at that energy falls below the extrapolated radio spectrum. Synchrotron radiation may contribute significantly to the X-ray emission of remnants up to several thousand years old.},

	Abstract = {Flows of synchrotron-emitting material can be found in several astrophysical contexts, including extragalactic jets and pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe). For X-ray synchrotron emission, flow times are often longer than electron radiative lifetimes, so the effective source size at a given X-ray energy is the distance electrons radiating at that energy can convect before they burn off. Since synchrotron losses vary strongly with electron energy, the source size drops with increasing X-ray energy, resulting in a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum. For homogeneous sources, this burnoff produces the well known result of a steepening by 0.5 in the source's integrated spectral index. However, for inhomogeneous sources, different amounts of steepening are possible. I exhibit a simple phenomenological picture of an outflow of relativistic electrons with bulk nonrelativistic flow speed, with transverse flow-tube radius, magnetic field strength, matter density, and flow velocity all varying as different powers of distance from the injection point. For such a picture, I calculate the value of the spectral index above the break as a function of the power-law indices, and show the possible range of steepenings. I show that these simple calculations are confirmed by full integrations of source luminosity, which also include the spectral "bump" below the break from the accumulation of electrons formerly at higher energies. In many cases, extragalactic jets show X-ray synchrotron emission steeper by more than 0.5 than the radio emission; the same phenomenon is exhibited by many PWNe. It is possible that source inhomogeneities are responsible in at least some cases, so that the amount of spectral steepening becomes a diagnostic for source dynamical or geometrical properties.},

	Abstract = {The self-consistent interaction between energetic particles and self-generated hydromagnetic waves in a cosmic ray pressure dominated plasma is considered. Using a three-dimensional hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-kinetic code, which utilizes a spherical harmonic expansion of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, high-resolution simulations of the magnetic field growth including feedback on the cosmic rays are carried out. It is found that for shocks with high cosmic ray acceleration efficiency, the magnetic fields become highly disorganized, resulting in near isotropic diffusion, independent of the initial orientation of the ambient magnetic field. The possibility of sub-Bohm diffusion is demonstrated for parallel shocks, while the diffusion coefficient approaches the Bohm limit from below for oblique shocks. This universal behaviour suggests that Bohm diffusion in the root-mean-squared field inferred from observation may provide a realistic estimate for the maximum energy acceleration time-scale in young supernova remnants. Although disordered, the magnetic field is not self-similar suggesting a non-uniform energy-dependent behaviour of the energetic particle transport in the precursor. Possible indirect radiative signatures of cosmic ray driven magnetic field amplification are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the damping of strong magnetic turbulence downstream of the forward shock of young supernova remnants (SNRs). We find that strong magnetic fields that have been produced by the streaming instability in the upstream region of the shock or by other kinetic instabilities at the shock may be efficiently damped, so the region of enhanced magnetic field strength would typically have a thickness of the order ld=1016-1017 cm. The nonthermal X-ray filaments observed in young SNRs are thus possibly limited by the magnetic field and not by the energy losses of the radiating electrons. Therefore, the thickness of the filaments would not be a measure of the magnetic field strength, and claims of efficient cosmic-ray acceleration on account of a runaway streaming instability would appear premature.},

	Abstract = {Constraints on the diffusion and acceleration parameters in five young supernova remnants (SNRs) are derived from the observed thickness of their X-ray rims, as limited by the synchrotron losses of the highest energy electrons, assuming uniform and isotropic turbulence. From a joint study of the electrons diffusion and advection in the downstream medium of the shock, it is shown that the magnetic field must be amplified up to values between 250 and 500 muG in the case of Cas A, Kepler, and Tycho, or ˜ 100 muG in the case of SN 1006 and G347.3-0.5. The diffusion coefficient at the highest electron energy can also be derived from the data, by relating the X-ray energy cutoff to the acceleration timescale. Values typically between 1 and 10 times the Bohm diffusion coefficient are found to be required. We also find interesting constraints on the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, by requiring that the diffusion coefficient at the maximum proton energy be not smaller than the Bohm value in the amplified field. This favours diffusion regime between the Kraichnan and the Bohm regime, and rejects turbulence spectrum indices larger than ~= 3/2. Finally, the maximum energy of the accelerated particles is found to lay between 1013 and 5× 1013 eV for electrons, and around Z× 8× 1014 eV at most for nuclei (or ˜ 2.5 times less if a Bohm diffusion regime is assumed), roughly independently of the compression ratio assumed at the shock. Even by taking advantage of the uncertainties on the measured parameters, it appears very difficult for the considered SNRs in their current stage of evolution to produce protons up to the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum, at ˜ 3× 1015 eV, and essentially impossible to accelerate Fe nuclei up to either the ankle at ˜ 3× 1018 eV or the second knee at ˜ 5× 1017 eV.},

	Abstract = {The theory of non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) predicts the formation of a precursor upstream of the shock, where accelerated particles diffuse and induce magnetic field amplification (MFA) through streaming instability. The non-detection of this precursor in X-rays in Chandra observations of the north-eastern region of SN 1006 (G329.6+14.6) led the authors of some previous work to impose an upper limit to the X-ray emission generated by accelerated electrons diffusing in this precursor, at an emissivity level of <1.5 per cent of the emission from the downstream region. This has been used as an argument against Fermi acceleration at this shock. Here, we calculate the spectrum and spatial distribution of accelerated particles in SN 1006 and show that Chandra results (including more recent data) are in perfect agreement with the predictions of NLDSA suggesting efficient particle acceleration and MFA upstream of the shock by a factor of ~10.},

	Abstract = {Context: Efficient particle acceleration can modify the structure of supernova remnants. We present the results of a combined analysis of the XMM-Newton EPIC archive observations of SN 1006.  Aims: We attempt to describe the spatial distribution of the physical and chemical properties of the X-ray emitting plasma at the shock front. We investigate the contribution of thermal and non-thermal emission to the X-ray spectrum at the rim of the remnant to study how the acceleration processes affect the X-ray emitting plasma.  Methods: We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis of a set of regions covering the entire rim of the shell and we apply our results in producing a count-rate image of the ``pure'' thermal emission of SN 1006 in the 0.5-0.8 keV energy band (subtracting the non-thermal contribution). This image differs significantly from the total image in the same band, especially close to the bright limbs.  Results: We find that thermal X-ray emission can be associated with the ejecta and study the azimuthal variation in the physical and chemical properties of the ejecta by identifying anisotropies in the temperature and chemical composition. By employing our thermal image, we trace the position of the contact discontinuity over the entire shell and compare it with that expected from 3D MHD models of SNRs with an unmodified shock. Conclusions: We conclude that the shock is modified everywhere in the rim and that the aspect angle between the interstellar magnetic field and the line of sight is significantly lower than 90$\,^{\circ}$.},

	Abstract = {Context. Thin X-ray filaments are observed in the vicinity of young supernova remnants (SNR) blast waves. Identifying the process that creates these filaments would provide direct insight into the particle acceleration occurring within SNR and in particular the cosmic ray yield.  Aims: We investigate magnetic amplification in the upstream medium of a SNR blast wave through both resonant and non-resonant regimes of the streaming instability. We attempt to understand more clearly of the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) efficiency by considering various relaxation processes of the magnetic fluctuations in the downstream medium. Multiwavelength radiative signatures originating in the SNR shock wave are used to test various downstream turbulence relaxation models.  Methods: Analytical and numerical calculations that couple stochastic differential equation schemes with 1D spherical magnetohydrodynamics simulations are used to investigate, in the context of test particles, turbulence evolution in both the forshock and post-shock regions. Stochastic second-order Fermi acceleration induced by resonant modes, magnetic field relaxation and amplification, and turbulence compression at the shock front are considered to model the multiwavelength filaments produced in SNRs. The gamma-ray emission is also considered in terms of inverse Compton mechanism.  Results: We confirm the result of Parizot and collaborators that the maximum CR energies should not go well beyond PeV energies in young SNRs where X-ray filaments are observed. To reproduce observational data, we derive an upper limit to the magnetic field amplitude and so ensure that stochastic particle reacceleration remains inefficient. Considering various magnetic relaxation processes, we then infer two necessary conditions to achieve efficient acceleration and X-ray filaments in SNRs: (1) the turbulence must fulfil the inequality 2 - beta - delta_d >= 0; where beta is the turbulence spectral index and delta_d is the relaxation length energy power-law index; (2) the typical relaxation length must be of the order the X-ray rim size. We find that Alv{\'e}nic/fast magnetosonic mode damping fulfils all conditions; while non-linear Kolmogorov damping does not. By confronting previous relaxation processes with observational data, we deducte that among our SNR sample, data for the older ones (SN1006 and G347.3-0.5) does not comply with all conditions, which means that their X-ray filaments are probably controlled by radiative losses. The younger SNRs, Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and Kepler pass all tests and we infer that the downstream magnetic field amplitude is in the range of 200-300 muGauss.},

The electron spectral behavior with respect to galactic height and energy indicates that convection provides a 'break' in the steady-state energy spectrum without recourse to distribution of sources. Radio observations of NGC 891 and NGC 4631 galaxies can be used to estimate their diffusion coefficient and its energy dependence. Application of analytical solutions to our Galaxy indicates that the diffusion coefficient and outflow velocity deduced from relativistic electron measurements and radio observations of their synchrotron radiation agree with values based on the transport of the cosmic ray nucleonic component.},

	Abstract = {The northeast shell of SN 1006 is the most probable acceleration site of high-energy electrons (up to ~100 TeV) with the Fermi acceleration mechanism at the shock front. We resolved nonthermal filaments from thermal emission in the shell with the excellent spatial resolution of Chandra. The thermal component is extended over ~100" (about 1 pc at 1.8 kpc distance) in width, consistent with the shock width derived from the Sedov solution. The spectrum is fitted with a thin thermal plasma of kT=0.24 keV in nonequilibrium ionization, typical for a young supernova remnant. The nonthermal filaments are likely thin sheets with scale widths of ~4" (0.04 pc) and ~20" (0.2 pc) upstream and downstream, respectively. The spectra of the filaments are fitted with a power-law function of index 2.1-2.3, with no significant variation from position to position. In a standard diffusive shock acceleration model, the extremely small scale length in the upstream region requires the magnetic field nearly perpendicular to the shock normal. The injection efficiency (eta) from thermal to nonthermal electrons around the shock front is estimated to be ~1×10-3 under the assumption that the magnetic field in the upstream region is 10 muG. In the filaments, the energy densities of the magnetic field and nonthermal electrons are similar to each other, and both are slightly smaller than that of thermal electrons. These results suggest that the acceleration occurs in more compact regions with larger efficiency than suggested by previous studies.},

	Abstract = {The Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) Vela Jr. (RX J0852.0-4622, G266.6-1.2) shows sharp filamentary structures on its northwestern edge in the hard X-ray band. The filaments are very smooth and located on the extreme outside edge of the remnant. We measured the averaged scale width of the filaments (wu and wd) with excellent spatial resolution with Chandra, and they are on the order of the size of the point-spread function of Chandra on the upstream side and 49.5" (36.0"-88.8") on the downstream side. The spectra of the filaments are very hard and have no linelike structure; they were well reproduced with an absorbed power-law model with Gamma=2.67 (2.55-2.77) or a SRCUT model with nuroll=4.3 (3.4-5.3)×1016 Hz under the assumption of p=0.3. These results imply that the hard X-rays are synchrotron radiation emitted by accelerated electrons, as mentioned previously. Using a correlation between the function B≡nuroll/w2d and the SNR age, we estimated the distance and the age of Vela Jr.: the estimated distance and age are 0.33 (0.26-0.50) kpc and 660 (420-1400) yr, respectively. These results are consistent with previous reports, implying that the B-age relation may be a useful tool for estimating the distance and the age of synchrotron X-ray-emitting SNRs.},

	Abstract = {X-ray synchrotron emission tells us of the highest energy reached by accelerated electrons. In a few supernova remnants (SN 1006, G347.3-0.5) this is the dominant form of X-ray radiation, but in most it is superposed to the dominant thermal emission. Thanks to the spectro-imaging capability of Chandra and XMM-Newton, X-ray synchrotron emission has now been unambiguously detected in most young supernova remnants (Cas A, Tycho, Kepler). It arises in a very thin shell (a few arcsecs) at the blast wave. The thinness of that shell (much broader in the radio domain) implies that the high energy electrons cool down very fast behind the shock. The magnetic field that one deduces from that constraint is more than 100 muG behind the shock.},

	Abstract = {A discussion of the effect of local losses on the acceleration of energetic particles by shocks is presented, which considers the energy losses of individual particles and the damping processes for the scattering hydromagnetic waves by means of time asymptotic and steady-state calculations. For acceleration to be a local effect within the Galaxy, the local scattering mean free path must be small by comparison with the effective overall galactic mean free path deduced from the cosmic-ray escape time. Given the spatial extent of the layer for strong shocks propagating into neutral interstellar clouds, the possibility of localized diffusive acceleration is investigated. The estimated strength and extent of the scattering region is not large enough to confine acceleration within the layer, which will instead extend across the entire cloud. The integrated losses of the cloud will then determine the efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Context. Young supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit narrow filaments of non-thermal X-ray emission whose widths can be limited either by electron energy losses or damping of the magnetic field.  Aims: We want to investigate whether or not different models of these filaments can be observationally tested.  Methods: Using observational parameters of four historical remnants, we calculated the filament profiles and compared the spectra of the filaments with those of the total non-thermal emission. For that purpose, we solved a one-dimensional stationary transport equation for the isotropic differential number density of the electrons.  Results: We find that the difference between the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission above 1 keV is more pronounced in the damping model than in the energy-loss model.  Conclusions: A considerable damping of the magnetic field can result in an observable difference between the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission, thus potentially permitting an observational discrimination between the energy-loss model and the damping model of the X-ray filaments.},

	Abstract = {We use the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to study the region in the Tycho supernova remnant between the blast wave and the shocked ejecta interface or contact discontinuity. This zone contains all the history of the shock-heated gas and cosmic-ray acceleration in the remnant. We present for the first time evidence for significant spatial variations of the X-ray synchrotron emission in the form of spectral steepening from a photon index of ~2.6 right at the blast wave to a value of ~3.0 several arcseconds behind. We interpret this result along with the profiles of radio and X-ray intensity using a self-similar hydrodynamical model including cosmic-ray back-reaction that accounts for the observed ratio of radii between the blast wave and contact discontinuity. Two different assumptions were made about the postshock magnetic field evolution: one where the magnetic field (amplified at the shock) is simply carried by the plasma flow and remains relatively high in the postshock region (synchrotron losses limited rim case), and another where the amplified magnetic field is rapidly damped behind the blast wave (magnetic damping case). Both cases fairly well describe the X-ray data; however, both fail to explain the observed radio profile. The projected synchrotron emission leaves little room for the presence of thermal emission from the shocked ambient medium. This can only be explained if the preshock ambient medium density in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova remnant is below 0.6 cm-3.},

@article{blandford1987,
	Abstract = {The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at collisionless astrophysical shock fronts is reviewed. Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfv{\'e}n waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfv{\'e}n waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},
