	Abstract = {The outer shells of young supernova remnants (SNRs) are the most plausible acceleration sites of high-energy electrons with the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. We studied spatial and spectral properties close to the shock fronts in four historical SNRs (Cas A, Kepler's remnant, Tycho's remnant, and RCW 86) with excellent spatial resolution of Chandra. In all of the SNRs, hard X-ray emissions were found on the rims of the SNRs, which concentrate in very narrow regions (so-called filaments); apparent scale widths on the upstream side are below or on the order of the point-spread function of Chandra, while they are 0.5"-40" (0.01-0.4 pc) on the downstream side with most reliable distances. The spectra of these filaments can be fitted with both thermal and nonthermal (power law and SRCUT) models. The former requires unrealistic high temperature (>~2 keV) and low abundances (<~1 solar) for emission from young SNRs and may be thus unlikely. The latter reproduces the spectra with best-fit photon indices of 2.1-3.8, or roll-off frequencies of (0.1-28)Ã—1017 Hz, which reminds us of the synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated via DSA. We consider various physical parameters as functions of the SNR age, including the previous results on SN 1006; the filament width on the downstream side increases with the SNR age, and the spectrum becomes softer, keeping a nonthermal feature. It was also found that a function, that is, the roll-off frequency divided by the square of the scale width on the downstream side, shows negative correlation with the age, which might provide us some information on the DSA theory.},

@article{ghavamian2000,
	Abstract = {We report optical spectroscopy and imaging of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) which suggest that two different precursors are associated with the blast wave. In long-slit spectra of the eastern rim, we find diffuse Halpha emission extending >~1' ahead of Knot g, a bright nonradiative shock propagating at velocity ~2000 km s-1. In addition to the hydrogen lines, the diffuse spectrum also exhibits [S II] lambdalambda6716, 6731; [N II] lambda6583 and weak [O III] lambda5007 emission. Narrowband imagery of Tycho's SNR shows that the diffuse emission extends ahead of most of the Balmer-dominated optical filaments and drops sharply in the remnant interior, suggesting that the diffuse gas is overrun by the supernova shock. The line ratios of the diffuse gas are compared with predictions from a simple He II lambda304 photoionization precursor model. The models predict that the radiative transfer of He II lambda304 photons in the precursor produces spatially distinct ionization layers of H0, He0-He+, N0-N++, O0-O++, and S+-S+3 ahead of the shock. The models suggest that the diffuse emission arises from collisional excitation in mostly neutral gas which has been heated to a temperature ~12,000 K. In high-resolution echelle spectra of Knot g, we find that the narrow Halpha component is broadened to 44+/-4 km s-1, suggesting that the upstream gas may be further heated before it crosses the shock, perhaps by a fast neutral or cosmic-ray precursor. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Halpha line in both the diffuse region and Knot g will be required to definitively establish the existence of a second precursor.},

	Abstract = {Characteristic scale lengths of nonthermal X-rays from the SN 1006 NE rim, which are observed by Chandra, are interpreted in the context of diffusive shock acceleration with the assumption that the observed spatial profile of nonthermal X-rays corresponds to that of accelerated electrons with energies of a few tens of TeV. To explain the observed scale lengths, we construct two simple models with a test particle approximation, where the maximum energy of accelerated electrons is determined by the age of SN 1006 (age-limited model) or the energy loss (energy loss-limited model), and constrain the magnetic field configuration and the diffusion coefficients of accelerated electrons. When the magnetic field is nearly parallel to the shock normal, the magnetic field should be in the range of 20-85 muG and highly turbulent both upstream and downstream, which means that the mean free path of accelerated electrons is of the order of their gyro-radius (Bohm limit). This situation can be realized both in the age-limited and energy loss-limited model. On the other hand, when the magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the shock normal, which can exist only in the age-limited case, the magnetic field is several muG upstream and 14-20 muG downstream, and the upstream magnetic field is less turbulent than the downstream.},

@article{vink2003,
	Abstract = {We investigate the nonthermal X-ray emission from Cas A, using BeppoSAX, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory OSSE, and Chandra data. For the hard X-ray continuum we test the model proposed by Laming, which invokes nonthermal bremsstrahlung from electrons accelerated by lower hybrid plasma waves. The justification for this model comes from our determination of a lower limit to the average magnetic field of B>0.5 mG. For such high magnetic fields, the synchrotron losses are severe enough that most of the electron populations responsible for the radio emission have maximum electron energies well below the limit for which X-ray synchrotron emission is important. However, we do suggest that the rim surrounding Cas A, seen in Chandra continuum images, is X-ray synchrotron emission. The width of this rim of 1.5"-4" can be used to infer the magnetic field near the shock front, for which we estimate B=0.08-0.16 mG and electron energies of ~57-40 TeV. This magnetic field strength is lower than the average magnetic field but higher than what may be expected from shocked interstellar medium, suggesting either a high magnetic field in the wind of the progenitor or rapid postshock field amplification by nonlinear growth of plasma waves. Combining the two magnetic field measurements, we have constructed a simple two-zone model. Most of the radio emission comes from inside Cas A, where the magnetic field is strong. In contrast, the inverse Compton emission is dominated by emission from near the shock front. Only for our lower limit on the magnetic field strength near the shock front is it possible to explain the recent detection of TeV emission by the High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy experiment with inverse Compton emission, for which, in addition, we have to assume a rather high far-infrared photon density that should be twice as high as our best estimate of ~70 cm-3. Pion decay is therefore likely to be the dominant emission from Cas A at TeV energies.},

@article{reynolds1998,
	Abstract = {The diffusive shock acceleration process can accelerate particles to a maximum energy depending on the shock speed and age and on any competing loss processes on the particles. The shock waves of young supernova remnants can easily accelerate electrons to energies in excess of 1 TeV, where they can produce X-rays by the synchrotron process. I describe a detailed calculation of the morphology and spectrum of synchrotron X-rays from supernova remnants. Remnants are assumed to be spherical and in the Sedov evolutionary phase, though the results are insensitive to the detailed dynamics. The upstream magnetic field is assumed uniform; downstream it is assumed to be compressed but not additionally turbulently amplified. In all cases, spectra begin to depart from power laws somewhere in the optical to UV range and roll off smoothly through the X-ray band. I show that simple approximations for the electron emissivity are not adequate; a full convolution of the individual electron synchrotron emissivity with a calculated electron distribution at each point in the remnant is required. Models limited by the finite shock age, by synchrotron or inverse Compton losses on electrons, or by escape of electrons above some energy have characteristically different spectral shapes, but within each class, models resemble one another strongly and can be related by simple scalings. The images and spectra depend primarily on the remnant age, the upstream magnetic field strength, and the level of magnetic turbulence near the shock in which the electrons scatter. In addition, images depend on the viewing or aspect angle between the upstream magnetic field and the line of sight. The diffusion coefficient is assumed to be proportional to particle energy (or mean free path proportional to gyroradius), but I investigate the possibility that the proportionality constant becomes much larger above some energy, corresponding to an absence of long-wavelength MHD waves. Models producing similar spectra may differ significantly in morphology, which allows for possible discriminations. I parameterize the model spectra in terms of a slope at 4 keV and a factor by which the X-ray flux density at that energy falls below the extrapolated radio spectrum. Synchrotron radiation may contribute significantly to the X-ray emission of remnants up to several thousand years old.},

@article{reynolds2009,
	Abstract = {Flows of synchrotron-emitting material can be found in several astrophysical contexts, including extragalactic jets and pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe). For X-ray synchrotron emission, flow times are often longer than electron radiative lifetimes, so the effective source size at a given X-ray energy is the distance electrons radiating at that energy can convect before they burn off. Since synchrotron losses vary strongly with electron energy, the source size drops with increasing X-ray energy, resulting in a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum. For homogeneous sources, this burnoff produces the well known result of a steepening by 0.5 in the source's integrated spectral index. However, for inhomogeneous sources, different amounts of steepening are possible. I exhibit a simple phenomenological picture of an outflow of relativistic electrons with bulk nonrelativistic flow speed, with transverse flow-tube radius, magnetic field strength, matter density, and flow velocity all varying as different powers of distance from the injection point. For such a picture, I calculate the value of the spectral index above the break as a function of the power-law indices, and show the possible range of steepenings. I show that these simple calculations are confirmed by full integrations of source luminosity, which also include the spectral "bump" below the break from the accumulation of electrons formerly at higher energies. In many cases, extragalactic jets show X-ray synchrotron emission steeper by more than 0.5 than the radio emission; the same phenomenon is exhibited by many PWNe. It is possible that source inhomogeneities are responsible in at least some cases, so that the amount of spectral steepening becomes a diagnostic for source dynamical or geometrical properties.},

	Abstract = {The self-consistent interaction between energetic particles and self-generated hydromagnetic waves in a cosmic ray pressure dominated plasma is considered. Using a three-dimensional hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-kinetic code, which utilizes a spherical harmonic expansion of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, high-resolution simulations of the magnetic field growth including feedback on the cosmic rays are carried out. It is found that for shocks with high cosmic ray acceleration efficiency, the magnetic fields become highly disorganized, resulting in near isotropic diffusion, independent of the initial orientation of the ambient magnetic field. The possibility of sub-Bohm diffusion is demonstrated for parallel shocks, while the diffusion coefficient approaches the Bohm limit from below for oblique shocks. This universal behaviour suggests that Bohm diffusion in the root-mean-squared field inferred from observation may provide a realistic estimate for the maximum energy acceleration time-scale in young supernova remnants. Although disordered, the magnetic field is not self-similar suggesting a non-uniform energy-dependent behaviour of the energetic particle transport in the precursor. Possible indirect radiative signatures of cosmic ray driven magnetic field amplification are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the damping of strong magnetic turbulence downstream of the forward shock of young supernova remnants (SNRs). We find that strong magnetic fields that have been produced by the streaming instability in the upstream region of the shock or by other kinetic instabilities at the shock may be efficiently damped, so the region of enhanced magnetic field strength would typically have a thickness of the order ld=1016-1017 cm. The nonthermal X-ray filaments observed in young SNRs are thus possibly limited by the magnetic field and not by the energy losses of the radiating electrons. Therefore, the thickness of the filaments would not be a measure of the magnetic field strength, and claims of efficient cosmic-ray acceleration on account of a runaway streaming instability would appear premature.},

	Abstract = {Constraints on the diffusion and acceleration parameters in five young supernova remnants (SNRs) are derived from the observed thickness of their X-ray rims, as limited by the synchrotron losses of the highest energy electrons, assuming uniform and isotropic turbulence. From a joint study of the electrons diffusion and advection in the downstream medium of the shock, it is shown that the magnetic field must be amplified up to values between 250 and 500 muG in the case of Cas A, Kepler, and Tycho, or Ëœ 100 muG in the case of SN 1006 and G347.3-0.5. The diffusion coefficient at the highest electron energy can also be derived from the data, by relating the X-ray energy cutoff to the acceleration timescale. Values typically between 1 and 10 times the Bohm diffusion coefficient are found to be required. We also find interesting constraints on the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, by requiring that the diffusion coefficient at the maximum proton energy be not smaller than the Bohm value in the amplified field. This favours diffusion regime between the Kraichnan and the Bohm regime, and rejects turbulence spectrum indices larger than ~= 3/2. Finally, the maximum energy of the accelerated particles is found to lay between 1013 and 5Ã— 1013 eV for electrons, and around ZÃ— 8Ã— 1014 eV at most for nuclei (or Ëœ 2.5 times less if a Bohm diffusion regime is assumed), roughly independently of the compression ratio assumed at the shock. Even by taking advantage of the uncertainties on the measured parameters, it appears very difficult for the considered SNRs in their current stage of evolution to produce protons up to the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum, at Ëœ 3Ã— 1015 eV, and essentially impossible to accelerate Fe nuclei up to either the ankle at Ëœ 3Ã— 1018 eV or the second knee at Ëœ 5Ã— 1017 eV.},

	Abstract = {The theory of non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) predicts the formation of a precursor upstream of the shock, where accelerated particles diffuse and induce magnetic field amplification (MFA) through streaming instability. The non-detection of this precursor in X-rays in Chandra observations of the north-eastern region of SN 1006 (G329.6+14.6) led the authors of some previous work to impose an upper limit to the X-ray emission generated by accelerated electrons diffusing in this precursor, at an emissivity level of <1.5 per cent of the emission from the downstream region. This has been used as an argument against Fermi acceleration at this shock. Here, we calculate the spectrum and spatial distribution of accelerated particles in SN 1006 and show that Chandra results (including more recent data) are in perfect agreement with the predictions of NLDSA suggesting efficient particle acceleration and MFA upstream of the shock by a factor of ~10.},

	Abstract = {Context: Efficient particle acceleration can modify the structure of supernova remnants. We present the results of a combined analysis of the XMM-Newton EPIC archive observations of SN 1006.  Aims: We attempt to describe the spatial distribution of the physical and chemical properties of the X-ray emitting plasma at the shock front. We investigate the contribution of thermal and non-thermal emission to the X-ray spectrum at the rim of the remnant to study how the acceleration processes affect the X-ray emitting plasma.  Methods: We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis of a set of regions covering the entire rim of the shell and we apply our results in producing a count-rate image of the ``pure'' thermal emission of SN 1006 in the 0.5-0.8 keV energy band (subtracting the non-thermal contribution). This image differs significantly from the total image in the same band, especially close to the bright limbs.  Results: We find that thermal X-ray emission can be associated with the ejecta and study the azimuthal variation in the physical and chemical properties of the ejecta by identifying anisotropies in the temperature and chemical composition. By employing our thermal image, we trace the position of the contact discontinuity over the entire shell and compare it with that expected from 3D MHD models of SNRs with an unmodified shock. Conclusions: We conclude that the shock is modified everywhere in the rim and that the aspect angle between the interstellar magnetic field and the line of sight is significantly lower than 90$\,^{\circ}$.},

	Abstract = {Context. Thin X-ray filaments are observed in the vicinity of young supernova remnants (SNR) blast waves. Identifying the process that creates these filaments would provide direct insight into the particle acceleration occurring within SNR and in particular the cosmic ray yield.  Aims: We investigate magnetic amplification in the upstream medium of a SNR blast wave through both resonant and non-resonant regimes of the streaming instability. We attempt to understand more clearly of the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) efficiency by considering various relaxation processes of the magnetic fluctuations in the downstream medium. Multiwavelength radiative signatures originating in the SNR shock wave are used to test various downstream turbulence relaxation models.  Methods: Analytical and numerical calculations that couple stochastic differential equation schemes with 1D spherical magnetohydrodynamics simulations are used to investigate, in the context of test particles, turbulence evolution in both the forshock and post-shock regions. Stochastic second-order Fermi acceleration induced by resonant modes, magnetic field relaxation and amplification, and turbulence compression at the shock front are considered to model the multiwavelength filaments produced in SNRs. The gamma-ray emission is also considered in terms of inverse Compton mechanism.  Results: We confirm the result of Parizot and collaborators that the maximum CR energies should not go well beyond PeV energies in young SNRs where X-ray filaments are observed. To reproduce observational data, we derive an upper limit to the magnetic field amplitude and so ensure that stochastic particle reacceleration remains inefficient. Considering various magnetic relaxation processes, we then infer two necessary conditions to achieve efficient acceleration and X-ray filaments in SNRs: (1) the turbulence must fulfil the inequality 2 - beta - delta_d >= 0; where beta is the turbulence spectral index and delta_d is the relaxation length energy power-law index; (2) the typical relaxation length must be of the order the X-ray rim size. We find that Alv{\'e}nic/fast magnetosonic mode damping fulfils all conditions; while non-linear Kolmogorov damping does not. By confronting previous relaxation processes with observational data, we deducte that among our SNR sample, data for the older ones (SN1006 and G347.3-0.5) does not comply with all conditions, which means that their X-ray filaments are probably controlled by radiative losses. The younger SNRs, Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and Kepler pass all tests and we infer that the downstream magnetic field amplitude is in the range of 200-300 muGauss.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents exact analytical solutions which describe steady-state transport of relativistic electrons subject to diffusion, convection, and radiation losses. The diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy dependent; the bulk convection velocity is considered to be constant and directed outward from the galactic plane. The electron spectral behavior with respect to galactic height and energy indicates that convection provides a 'break' in the steady-state energy spectrum without recourse to distribution of sources. Radio observations of NGC 891 and NGC 4631 galaxies can be used to estimate their diffusion coefficient and its energy dependence. Application of analytical solutions to our Galaxy indicates that the diffusion coefficient and outflow velocity deduced from relativistic electron measurements and radio observations of their synchrotron radiation agree with values based on the transport of the cosmic ray nucleonic component.},

	Abstract = {An attempt is made to evaluate the maximum energy, E(max), that particles subjected to the diffusive shock acceleration process can acquire during an SNR's lifetime. The rate of acceleration depends on the particle diffusion coefficient, which is determined by the level of hydromagnetic wave energy present at a scale that is comparable to the particle Larmor radius. Attention is given to diffusion coefficient variations as a function of momentum, space, and time. Given a realistic diffusion coefficient behavior value, an E(max) of less than about 10,000 GeV/n is obtained, signifying that supernova shock acceleration cannot account for the observed spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the 1-1,000,000 GeV/n energy range.},

We find that the proper motion of the forward shock is about 0farcs48 yr-1 and does not vary around the rim within the ~10% measurement uncertainties. The proper motion measured is consistent with that determined by previous radio observations. The mean expansion index of the forward shock is calculated to be ~0.54 which matches the value expected based on an evolutionary model of a Type Ia supernova with either a power-law or an exponential ejecta density profile. Assuming pressure equilibrium around the periphery from the thermally dominated northwestern rim to the nonthermally dominated northeastern rim, we estimate the ambient density to the northeast of SN 1006 to be ~0.085 cm-3.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that the nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) fits the shell-type nonthermal X-ray morphology, obtained in Chandra observations, in a satisfactory way. The set of empirical parameters is the same which reproduces the dynamical properties of the SNR and the spectral characteristics of the emission produced by CRs. The extremely small spatial scales of the observed X-ray distribution are due to the large effective magnetic field B_d ~  100 mu G in the interior, which is also required to give a good fit for the spatially integrated radio and X-ray synchrotron spectra. The only reasonably thinkable condition for the production of such a large effective field strength is an efficiently accelerated nuclear CR component. Therefore the Chandra data confirm the inference that SN 1006 indeed accelerates nuclear CRs with the high efficiency required for SNRs to be considered as the main Galactic CR sources.},

@article{bamba2003,
	Abstract = {The northeast shell of SN 1006 is the most probable acceleration site of high-energy electrons (up to ~100 TeV) with the Fermi acceleration mechanism at the shock front. We resolved nonthermal filaments from thermal emission in the shell with the excellent spatial resolution of Chandra. The thermal component is extended over ~100" (about 1 pc at 1.8 kpc distance) in width, consistent with the shock width derived from the Sedov solution. The spectrum is fitted with a thin thermal plasma of kT=0.24 keV in nonequilibrium ionization, typical for a young supernova remnant. The nonthermal filaments are likely thin sheets with scale widths of ~4" (0.04 pc) and ~20" (0.2 pc) upstream and downstream, respectively. The spectra of the filaments are fitted with a power-law function of index 2.1-2.3, with no significant variation from position to position. In a standard diffusive shock acceleration model, the extremely small scale length in the upstream region requires the magnetic field nearly perpendicular to the shock normal. The injection efficiency (eta) from thermal to nonthermal electrons around the shock front is estimated to be ~1Ã—10-3 under the assumption that the magnetic field in the upstream region is 10 muG. In the filaments, the energy densities of the magnetic field and nonthermal electrons are similar to each other, and both are slightly smaller than that of thermal electrons. These results suggest that the acceleration occurs in more compact regions with larger efficiency than suggested by previous studies.},

The filaments are very smooth and located on the extreme outside edge of the remnant. We measured the averaged scale width of the filaments (wu and wd) with excellent spatial resolution with Chandra, and they are on the order of the size of the point-spread function of Chandra on the upstream side and 49.5" (36.0"-88.8") on the downstream side. The spectra of the filaments are very hard and have no linelike structure; they were well reproduced with an absorbed power-law model with Gamma=2.67 (2.55-2.77) or a SRCUT model with nuroll=4.3 (3.4-5.3)Ã—1016 Hz under the assumption of p=0.3. These results imply that the hard X-rays are synchrotron radiation emitted by accelerated electrons, as mentioned previously. Using a correlation between the function Bâ‰¡nuroll/w2d and the SNR age, we estimated the distance and the age of Vela Jr.: the estimated distance and age are 0.33 (0.26-0.50) kpc and 660 (420-1400) yr, respectively. These results are consistent with previous reports, implying that the B-age relation may be a useful tool for estimating the distance and the age of synchrotron X-ray-emitting SNRs.},

In a few supernova remnants (SN 1006, G347.3-0.5) this is the dominant form of X-ray radiation, but in most it is superposed to the dominant thermal emission. Thanks to the spectro-imaging capability of Chandra and XMM-Newton, X-ray synchrotron emission has now been unambiguously detected in most young supernova remnants (Cas A, Tycho, Kepler). It arises in a very thin shell (a few arcsecs) at the blast wave. The thinness of that shell (much broader in the radio domain) implies that the high energy electrons cool down very fast behind the shock. The magnetic field that one deduces from that constraint is more than 100 muG behind the shock.},

For acceleration to be a local effect within the Galaxy, the local scattering mean free path must be small by comparison with the effective overall galactic mean free path deduced from the cosmic-ray escape time. Given the spatial extent of the layer for strong shocks propagating into neutral interstellar clouds, the possibility of localized diffusive acceleration is investigated. The estimated strength and extent of the scattering region is not large enough to confine acceleration within the layer, which will instead extend across the entire cloud. The integrated losses of the cloud will then determine the efficiency.},

Aims: We want to investigate whether or not different models of these filaments can be observationally tested.  Methods: Using observational parameters of four historical remnants, we calculated the filament profiles and compared the spectra of the filaments with those of the total non-thermal emission. For that purpose, we solved a one-dimensional stationary transport equation for the isotropic differential number density of the electrons.  Results: We find that the difference between the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission above 1 keV is more pronounced in the damping model than in the energy-loss model.  Conclusions: A considerable damping of the magnetic field can result in an observable difference between the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission, thus potentially permitting an observational discrimination between the energy-loss model and the damping model of the X-ray filaments.},

	Abstract = {We use the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to study the region in the Tycho supernova remnant between the blast wave and the shocked ejecta interface or contact discontinuity. This zone contains all the history of the shock-heated gas and cosmic-ray acceleration in the remnant. We present for the first time evidence for significant spatial variations of the X-ray synchrotron emission in the form of spectral steepening from a photon index of ~2.6 right at the blast wave to a value of ~3.0 several arcseconds behind. We interpret this result along with the profiles of radio and X-ray intensity using a self-similar hydrodynamical model including cosmic-ray back-reaction that accounts for the observed ratio of radii between the blast wave and contact discontinuity. Two different assumptions were made about the postshock magnetic field evolution: one where the magnetic field (amplified at the shock) is simply carried by the plasma flow and remains relatively high in the postshock region (synchrotron losses limited rim case), and another where the amplified magnetic field is rapidly damped behind the blast wave (magnetic damping case). Both cases fairly well describe the X-ray data; however, both fail to explain the observed radio profile. The projected synchrotron emission leaves little room for the presence of thermal emission from the shocked ambient medium. This can only be explained if the preshock ambient medium density in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova remnant is below 0.6 cm-3.},

@article{blandford1987,
	Abstract = {The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at collisionless astrophysical shock fronts is reviewed. Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfv{\'e}n waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfv{\'e}n waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},

@article{berezhko2004,
	Abstract = {It is shown that the nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) describes the shell-type nonthermal X-ray morphology of Cas A, obtained in Chandra observations, in a satisfactory way. The set of empirical parameters, like distance, source size and total energy release, is the same which reproduces the dynamical properties of the SNR and the spectral characteristics of the emission produced by CRs. The extremely small spatial scales in the observed morphological structures at hard X-ray energies are due to a large effective magnetic field B_dËœ 500 muG in the interior which is at the same time not only required but also sufficient to achieve the excellent agreement between the spatially integrated radio and X-ray synchrotron spectra and their calculated form. The only reasonably thinkable condition for the production of such a large effective field strength is a very efficiently accelerated nuclear CR component. Therefore the Chandra data confirm first of all the inference that Cas A indeed accelerates nuclear CRs with the high efficiency required for Cas A to be considered as a member of the main class of Galactic CR sources and, secondly, that the nonlinear kinetic theory of CR acceleration in SNRs is a reliable method to determine the magnetic field value in SNRs.},

	Abstract = {Thin nonthermal X-ray filaments are often seen in young supernova remnants. We used data from the 1 Ms Chandra observation of Cassiopeia A to study spectral properties of some of the filaments in this remnant. For all the cases that we examined, the X-ray spectrum across the filaments hardens, at about 10% level, going outward, while observed filament widths depend only weakly on the photon energy. Using a model that includes radiative cooling, advection, and diffusion of accelerated particles behind the shock, we estimated the magnetic field, turbulence level, and shock obliquity.},
