	Abstract = {The instability in the cosmic-ray precursor of a supernova shock moving in interstellar medium is studied. The level of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in this region determines the maximum energy of particles accelerated by the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. A high efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration is accepted, and the consideration is not limited by the case of weak turbulence. It is assumed that Kolmogorov-type nonlinear wave interactions together with the ion-neutral collisions restrict the amplitude of the random magnetic field. As a result, the maximum energy of accelerated particles strongly depends on the age of the supernova remnant. The maximum energy can be as high as ~ 1017Z eV in young supernova remnants and falls to about ~ 1010Z eV at the end of the Sedov stage. Thus the standard estimate of maximum particle energy based on the Bohm limit calculated for the interstellar magnetic field strength is not justified in this case. This finding may explain why supernova remnants with age of more than a few thousand years are not prominent sources of very high energy gamma-rays.},

	Abstract = {Like many young supernova remnants, SN 1006 exhibits what appear to be clumps of ejecta close to or protruding beyond the main blast wave. In this Letter, we examine three such protrusions along the east rim. They are semi-aligned with ejecta fingers behind the shock-front and exhibit emission lines from O VII and O VIII. We first interpret them in the context of an upstream medium modified by the saturated non-resonant Bell instability which enhances the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities when advected post-shock. We discuss their apparent periodicity if the spacing is determined by properties of the remnant or by a preferred size scale in the cosmic ray precursor. We also briefly discuss the alternative that these structures have an origin in the ejecta structure of the explosion itself. In this case, the young evolutionary age of SN 1006 would imply density structure within the outermost layers of the explosion with potentially important implications for deflagration and detonation in thermonuclear supernova explosion models.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the properties of Fe-rich knots on the east limb of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant using observations with Chandra/ACIS and analysis methods developed in a companion paper. We use the fitted ionization age and electron temperature of the knots to constrain the ejecta density profile and the Lagrangian mass coordinates of the knots. Fe-rich knots that also have strong emission from Si, S, Ar, and Ca are clustered around mass coordinates q~=0.35-0.4 in the shocked ejecta; for ejecta mass 2Msolar, this places the knots 0.7-0.8Msolar out from the center (or 2-2.1Msolar, allowing for a 1.3Msolar compact object). We also find an Fe clump that is evidently devoid of line emission from lower mass elements, as would be expected if it were the product of alpha-rich freezeout; the mass coordinate of this clump is similar to those of the other Fe knots.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effect of the circumstellar medium density profile on the X-ray emission from outer ejecta knots in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant using the 1 Ms Chandra observation. The spectra of a number of radial series of ejecta knots at various positions around the remnant are analyzed using techniques similar to those devised in previous papers. We can obtain a reasonable match to our data for a circumstellar density profile proportional to r -2 as would arise from the steady dense wind of a red supergiant, but the agreement is improved if we introduce a small (0.2-0.3 pc) central cavity around the progenitor into our models. Such a profile might arise if the progenitor emitted a fast tenuous stellar wind for a short period immediately prior to explosion. We review other lines of evidence supporting this conclusion. The spectra also indicate the widespread presence of Fe-enriched plasma that was presumably formed by complete Si burning during the explosion, possibly via alpha-rich freezeout. This component is typically associated with hotter and more highly ionized gas than the bulk of the O- and Si-rich ejecta.},

@article{cassam-chenai2004,
	Abstract = {We present the first results coming from the observation of Kepler's supernova remnant obtained with the EPIC instruments on board the XMM-Newton satellite. We focus on the images and radial profiles of the emission lines (Si K, Fe L, Fe K) and of the high energy continuum. Chiefly, the Fe L and Si K emission-line images are generally consistent with each other and the radial profiles show that the Si K emission extends to a larger radius than the Fe L emission (distinctly in the southern part of the remnant). Therefore, in contrast to Cas A, no inversion of the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta layers is observed in Kepler. Moreover, the Fe K emission peaks at a smaller radius than the Fe L emission, which implies that the temperature increases inwards in the ejecta. The 4-6 keV high energy continuum map shows the same distribution as the asymmetric emission-line images except in the southeast where there is a strong additional emission. A two color image of the 4-6 keV and 8-10 keV high energy continuum illustrates that the hardness variations of the continuum are weak all along the remnant except in a few knots. The asymmetry in the Fe K emission-line is not associated with any asymmetry in the Fe K equivalent width map. The Si K maps lead to the same conclusions. Hence, abundance variations do not cause the north-south brightness asymmetry. The strong emission in the north may be due to overdensities in the circumstellar medium. In the southeastern region of the remnant, the lines have a very low equivalent width and the X-ray emission is largely nonthermal.},

	Abstract = {Upon formation, degenerate He core white dwarfs are surrounded by a radiative H-rich layer primarily supported by ideal gas pressure. In this Letter, we examine the effect of this H-rich layer on mass transfer in He+C/O double white dwarf binaries that will eventually merge and possibly yield a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in the double detonation scenario. Because its thermal profile and equation of state differ from the underlying He core, the H-rich layer is transferred stably onto the C/O white dwarf prior to the He core's tidal disruption. We find that this material is ejected from the binary system and sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium hundreds to thousands of years before the SN Ia. The close match between the resulting circumstellar medium profiles and values inferred from recent observations of circumstellar absorption in SNe Ia gives further credence to the resurgent double detonation scenario.},

@article{patnaude2012,
	Abstract = {It is now well established that Kepler's supernova remnant (SNR) is the result of a Type Ia explosion. With an age of 407 yr and an angular diameter of ~4', Kepler is estimated to be between 3.0 and 7.0 kpc distant. Unlike other Galactic Type Ia SNRs such as Tycho and SN 1006, and SNR 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, Kepler shows evidence for a strong circumstellar interaction. A bowshock structure in the north is thought to originate from the motion of a mass-losing system through the interstellar medium prior to the supernova. We present results of hydrodynamical and spectral modeling aimed at constraining the circumstellar environment of the system and the amount of 56Ni produced in the explosion. Using models that contain either 0.3 M &sun; (subenergetic) or 1.0 M &sun; (energetic) of 56Ni, we simulate the interaction between supernova Ia ejecta and various circumstellar density models. Based on dynamical considerations alone, we find that the subenergetic models favor a distance to the SNR of <6.4 kpc, while the model that produces 1 M &sun; of 56Ni requires a distance to the SNR of >7 kpc. The X-ray spectrum is consistent with an explosion that produced ~1 M &sun; of 56Ni, ruling out the subenergetic models, and suggesting that Kepler's SNR was an SN 1991T-like event. Additionally, the X-ray spectrum rules out a pure r -2 wind profile expected from isotropic mass loss up to the time of the supernova. Introducing a small cavity around the progenitor system results in modeled X-ray spectra that are consistent with the observed spectrum. If a wind-shaped circumstellar environment is necessary to explain the dynamics and X-ray emission from the shocked ejecta in Kepler's SNR, then we require that the distance to the remnant be greater than 7 kpc.},

	Abstract = {Using 3D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, we show that jets launched prior to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion in the core-degenerate (CD) scenario can account for the appearance of two opposite lobes (`Ears') along the symmetry axis of the SN remnant (SNR). In the double-degenerate (DD) and CD scenarios the merger of the two degenerate compact objects is very likely to lead to the formation of an accretion disc, that might launch two opposite jets. In the CD scenario, these jets interact with the envelope ejected during the preceding common envelope phase. If explosion occurs shortly after the merger process, the exploding gas and the jets will collide with the ejected nebula, leading to SNR with axisymmetric components including `Ears'. We also explore the possibility that the jets are launched by the companion white dwarf prior to its merger with the core. This last process is similar to the one where jets are launched in some pre-planetary nebulae. The SNR `Ears' in this case are formed by a spherical SN Ia explosion inside an elliptical planetary nebula-like object. We compare our numerical results with two SNRs - Kepler and G299.2-2.9.},

	Abstract = {We present a new analysis of the transport of cosmic rays in a turbulent magnetic field that varies in all three spatial dimensions. The analysis utilizes a numerical simulation that integrates the trajectories of an ensemble of test particles from which we obtain diffusion coefficients based on the particle motions. We find that the diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean magnetic field is consistent with values deduced from quasi-linear theory, in agreement with earlier work. The more interesting and less understood transport perpendicular to the average magnetic field is found to be enhanced (above the classical scattering result) by the random walk, or braiding, of the magnetic field. The value of kappa⊥ obtained is generally larger than the classical scattering value but smaller than the quasi-linear value. The computed values of kappa⊥/kappa||, for a representation of the interplanetary magnetic field, are 0.02-0.04 these values are of the same general magnitude as those assumed in recent numerical simulations of cosmic-ray modulation and transport in the heliosphere, and give reasonable agreement with spacecraft observations of cosmic rays. Some consequences of these results for the interpretation of heliospheric observations are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Electrons can be accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies at strong (high Mach number) collisionless shock waves that form when stellar debris rapidly expands after a supernova. Collisionless shock waves also form in the flow of particles from the Sun (the solar wind), and extensive spacecraft observations have established that electron acceleration at these shocks is effectively absent whenever the upstream magnetic field is roughly parallel to the shock-surface normal (quasi-parallel conditions). However, it is unclear whether this magnetic dependence of electron acceleration also applies to the far stronger shocks around young supernova remnants, where local magnetic conditions are poorly understood. Here we present Cassini spacecraft observations of an unusually strong solar system shock wave (Saturn's bow shock) where significant local electron acceleration has been confirmed under quasi-parallel magnetic conditions for the first time, contradicting the established magnetic dependence of electron acceleration at solar system shocks. Furthermore, the acceleration led to electrons at relativistic energies (about megaelectronvolt), comparable to the highest energies ever attributed to shock acceleration in the solar wind. These observations suggest that at high Mach numbers, such as those of young supernova remnant shocks, quasi-parallel shocks become considerably more effective electron accelerators.},

@article{ferrand2014,
	Abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to accelerate particles up to high energies through the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Except for direct plasma simulations, all modeling efforts must rely on a given form of the diffusion coefficient, a key parameter that embodies the interactions of energetic charged particles with magnetic turbulence. The so-called Bohm limit is commonly employed. In this paper, we revisit the question of acceleration at perpendicular shocks, by employing a realistic model of perpendicular diffusion. Our coefficient reduces to a power law in momentum for low momenta (of index alpha), but becomes independent of the particle momentum at high momenta (reaching a constant value kappa∞ above some characteristic momentum p c). We first provide simple analytical expressions of the maximum momentum that can be reached at a given time with this coefficient. Then we perform time-dependent numerical simulations to investigate the shape of the particle distribution that can be obtained when the particle pressure back-reacts on the flow. We observe that for a given index alpha and injection level, the shock modifications are similar for different possible values of p c, whereas the particle spectra differ markedly. Of particular interest, low values of p c tend to remove the concavity once thought to be typical of non-linear DSA, and result in steep spectra, as required by recent high-energy observations of Galactic SNRs.},

	Abstract = {We present a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of efficient diffusive shock acceleration where the magnetic turbulence responsible for particle diffusion is calculated self-consistently from the resonant cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability, together with non-resonant short- and long-wavelength CR-current-driven instabilities. We include the backpressure from CRs interacting with the strongly amplified magnetic turbulence which decelerates and heats the super-Alfv{\'e}nic flow in the extended shock precursor. Uniquely, in our plane-parallel, steady-state, multi-scale model, the full range of particles, from thermal (~eV) injected at the viscous subshock to the escape of the highest energy CRs (~PeV) from the shock precursor, are calculated consistently with the shock structure, precursor heating, magnetic field amplification, and scattering center drift relative to the background plasma. In addition, we show how the cascade of turbulence to shorter wavelengths influences the total shock compression, the downstream proton temperature, the magnetic fluctuation spectra, and accelerated particle spectra. A parameter survey is included where we vary shock parameters, the mode of magnetic turbulence generation, and turbulence cascading. From our survey results, we obtain scaling relations for the maximum particle momentum and amplified magnetic field as functions of shock speed, ambient density, and shock size.},

	Abstract = {The processes responsible for the broadband radiation of the young supernova remnant Cas A are explored by using a new code that is designed for a detailed treatment of the diffusive shock acceleration of particles in the nonlinear regime. The model is based on spherically symmetric hydrodynamic equations complemented with transport equations for relativistic particles. Electrons, protons, and the oxygen ions accelerated by forward and reverse shocks are included in the numerical calculations. We show that the available multi-wavelength observations in the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands can be best explained by invoking particle acceleration by both forward and reversed shocks. Although the TeV gamma-ray observations can be interpreted by interactions of both accelerated electrons and protons/ions, the measurements by Fermi Large Area Telescope at energies below 1 GeV give a tentative preference to the hadronic origin of gamma-rays. Then, the acceleration efficiency in this source, despite the previous claims, should be very high; 25% of the explosion energy (or approximately 3 × 1050 erg) should already be converted to cosmic rays, mainly by the forward shock. At the same time, the model calculations do not provide extension of the maximum energy of accelerated protons beyond 100 TeV. In this model, the acceleration of electrons is dominated by the reverse shock; the required 1048 erg can be achieved under the assumption that the injection of electrons (positrons) is supported by the radioactive decay of 44Ti.},

	Abstract = {We used unprecedentedly large two-dimensional and three-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions---fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless strong shocks in order to investigate the effects of self-consistently accelerated ions on the overall shock dynamics. The current driven by suprathermal particles streaming ahead of the shock excites modes transverse to the background magnetic field. The Lorentz force induced by these self-amplified fields tends to excavate tubular, underdense, magnetic-field-depleted cavities that are advected with the fluid and perturb the shock surface, triggering downstream turbulent motions. These motions further amplify the magnetic field, up to factors of 50-100 in knot-like structures. Once downstream, the cavities tend to be filled by hot plasma plumes that compress and stretch the magnetic fields in elongated filaments; this effect is particularly evident if the shock propagates parallel to the background field. Highly magnetized knots and filaments may provide explanations for the rapid X-ray variability observed in RX J1713.7-3946 and for the regular pattern of X-ray bright stripes detected in Tycho's supernova remnant.},

	Abstract = {The central idea of diffusive shock acceleration is presented from microscopic and macroscopic viewpoints; applied to reactionless test particles in a steady plane shock the mechanism is shown to produce a power law spectrum in momentum with a slope which, to lowest order in the ratio of plasma to particle speed, depends only on the compression in the shock. The associated time scale is found (also by a macroscopic and a microscopic method) and the problems of spherical shocks, as exemplified by a point explosion and a stellar-wind terminator, are treated by singular perturbation theory. The effect of including the particle reaction is then studied. It is shown that if the scattering is due to resonant waves these can rapidly grow with unknown consequences. The possible steady modified shock structures are classified and generalised Rankine-Hugoniot conditions found. Modifications of the spectrum are discussed on the basis of an exact, if rather artificial, solution, a high-energy asymptotic expansion and a perturbation expansion due to Blandford. It is pointed out that no steady solution can exist for very strong shocks; the possible time dependence is briefly discussed.},

Here we propose a semi-analytical kinetic method that allows us to calculate the shock modification induced by accelerated particles together with the efficiency for particle acceleration and the spectra of accelerated particles. The shock modification is calculated for arbitrary environment parameters (Mach number, maximum momentum, density) and for arbitrary diffusion properties of the medium.

	Abstract = {We calculate the flux of non-thermal radiations from the supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 in the context of the non-linear theory of particle acceleration at shocks, which allows us to take into account self-consistently the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles, the generation of magnetic fields in the shock proximity and the dynamical reaction of the magnetic field on the plasma. When the fraction of particles which get accelerated is of the order of ~10-4, we find that the strength of the magnetic field obtained as a result of streaming instability induced by cosmic rays is compatible with the interpretation of the X-ray emitting filaments being produced by strong synchrotron losses in ~100muG magnetic fields. The maximum energy of accelerated protons is >~105 GeV. If the X-ray filaments are explained in alternative ways, the constraint on the magnetic field downstream of the shock disappears and the HESS data can be marginally fitted with ICS of relativistic electrons off a complex population of photons, tailored to comprise cosmic microwave background and ambient infrared/optical photons. The fit, typically poor at the highest energies, requires a large density of target photons within the remnant; only a fraction of the order of ~10-6 of the background particles gets accelerated; the local magnetic field is of the order of ~20muG and the maximum energy of protons is much lower than the knee energy. Current HESS gamma-ray observations combined with recent X-ray observations by Suzaku do not allow as yet to draw a definitive conclusion on whether RX J1713.7-3946 is an efficient cosmic ray accelerator, although at the present time a hadronic interpretation of HESS data seems more likely. We discuss the implications of our results for the GLAST gamma-ray telescope, which should be able to discriminate the two scenarios discussed above, by observing the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum at lower energies.},

	Abstract = {A nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) is used to describe the properties of Tycho's SNR. Observations of the expansion characteristics and of the nonthermal radio and X-ray emission spectra, assumed to be of synchrotron origin, are used to constrain the overall dynamical evolution and the particle acceleration parameters of the system, in addition to what is known from independent estimates of the distance and thermal X-ray observations. It is shown that a very efficient production of nuclear cosmic rays, leading to strong shock modification, and a large downstream magnetic field strength Bd~240 mu G are required to reproduce the observed synchrotron emission from radio to X-ray frequencies. This field strength is still well within the upper bound for the effective magnetic field, consistent with the acceleration process. The pi 0-decay gamma -ray flux turns out to be somewhat greater than the inverse Compton (IC) flux off the Cosmic Microwave Background at energies below 1 TeV, dominating it strongly at 10 TeV. The predicted TeV gamma -ray flux is consistent with but close to the very low upper limit recently obtained by HEGRA.

	Abstract = {The nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) is used to describe the properties of the remnant of SN 1006. It is shown, that the theory fits the existing data in a satisfactory way within a set of parameters which is consistent with the idea that SN 1006 is a typical source of Galactic CR nucleons, although not necessarily of CR electrons. The adjusted parameters are those that are not very well determined by present theory or not directly amenable to astronomical observations. The calculated expansion law and the radio-, X-ray and gamma -ray emissions produced by the accelerated CRs in SN 1006 agree quite well with the observations. A rather large interior magnetic field B_d~ 100 mu G is required to give a good fit for the radio and X-ray synchrotron emission. In the predicted TeV gamma -ray flux from SN 1006, the pi 0-decay gamma -rays, generated by the nuclear CR component, dominate over the inverse Compton (IC) gamma -rays, generated by the CR electrons in the cosmic microwave background. The predicted source morphology in high energy gamma -rays roughly corresponds to that of the synchrotron emission. The predicted integral gamma -ray flux Fgamma ~ epsilon gamma -1 extends up to energies ~ 100 TeV if CR diffusion is as strong as the Bohm limit. Only if the interior magnetic field is much lower in the SNR, B_d~ 10 mu G, then the observed gamma -ray emission can be due to the accelerated electron component alone. In this case, not plausible physically in our view, the lowest permissible value of the electron to proton ratio is rather high, and the maximum individual energy and total energy content of accelerated nucleons so small, that SN 1006 can not be considered as a typical source of the nuclear Galactic CRs.},

	Abstract = {At the early, ejecta-dominated stage of supernova remnant (SNR) expansion, a fraction of the swept-up circumstellar magnetic field is dynamically compressed to approximate equipartition at the contact discontinuity separating the SN progenitor's wind (or the interstellar medium) and the ejecta. We propose that the thin nonthermal X-ray filaments observed by the Chandra satellite in several young SNRs are associated with such ``pile-up'' of the magnetic field. We use a one-dimensional diffusion-convection transport equation to describe the propagation of nonthermal electrons near the contact discontinuity of a young SNR and to calculate spatially resolved emission spectra in the X-ray and TeV bands. The results suggest that the high-energy electrons are possibly accelerated at the forward shock and emit efficiently only when they diffuse into regions of high magnetic field near the contact discontinuity. Much more likely, though, is that they are locally accelerated at the contact discontinuity, in which case the acceleration cannot be related to Fermi-type processes and should occur because of other plasma mechanisms. As a consequence, the forward shock in young SNRs is inconspicuous and often unobservable, similar to that in the Crab Nebula.},

	Abstract = {Context: Recent observations of hard X-rays and very high energy gamma-rays from a number of young shell type supernova remnants indicate the importance of detailed quantitative studies of energy spectra of relativistic electrons formed via diffusive shock acceleration accompanied by intense nonthermal emission through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering.  Aims: The aim of this work was derivation of exact asymptotic solutions of the kinetic equation which describes the energy distribution of shock-accelerated electrons for an arbitrary energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient.  Methods: The asymptotic solutions at low and very high energy domains coupled with numerical calculations in the intermediate energy range allow analytical presentations of energy spectra of electrons for the entire energy region.  Results: Under the assumption that the energy losses of electrons are dominated by synchrotron cooling, we derived the exact asymptotic spectra of electrons without any restriction on the diffusion coefficient. We also obtained simple analytical approximations which describe, with accuracy better than ten percent, the energy spectra of nonthermal emission of shock-accelerated electrons due to the synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering.  Conclusions: .The results can be applied for interpretation of X-ray and gamma-ray observations of shell type supernova remnants, as well as other nonthermal high energy source populations like microquasars and large scale synchrotron jets of active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Supernova remnants are beautiful astronomical objects that are also of high scientific interest, because they provide insights into supernova explosion mechanisms, and because they are the likely sources of Galactic cosmic rays. X-ray observations are an important means to study these objects. And in particular the advances made in X-ray imaging spectroscopy over the last two decades has greatly increased our knowledge about supernova remnants. It has made it possible to map the products of fresh nucleosynthesis, and resulted in the identification of regions near shock fronts that emit X-ray synchrotron radiation. Since X-ray synchrotron radiation requires 10-100 TeV electrons, which lose their energies rapidly, the study of X-ray synchrotron radiation has revealed those regions where active and rapid particle acceleration is taking place. In this text all the relevant aspects of X-ray emission from supernova remnants are reviewed and put into the context of supernova explosion properties and the physics and evolution of supernova remnants. The first half of this review has a more tutorial style and discusses the basics of supernova remnant physics and X-ray spectroscopy of the hot plasmas they contain. This includes hydrodynamics, shock heating, thermal conduction, radiation processes, non-equilibrium ionization, He-like ion triplet lines, and cosmic ray acceleration. The second half offers a review of the advances made in field of X-ray spectroscopy of supernova remnants during the last 15 year. This period coincides with the availability of X-ray imaging spectrometers. In addition, I discuss the results of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Chandra and XMM-Newton gratings. Although these instruments are not ideal for studying extended sources, they nevertheless provided interesting results for a limited number of remnants. These results provide a glimpse of what may be achieved with future microcalorimeters that will be available on board future X-ray observatories. In discussing the results of the last 15 years I have chosen to discuss a few topics that are of particular interest. These include the properties of Type Ia supernova remnants, which appear to be regularly shaped and have stratified ejecta, in contrast to core collapse supernova remnants, which have patchy ejecta distributions. For core collapse supernova remnants I discuss the spatial distribution of fresh nucleosynthesis products, but also their properties in connection to the neutron stars they contain. For the mature supernova remnants I focus on the prototypal supernova remnants Vela and the Cygnus Loop. And I discuss the interesting class of mixed-morphology remnants. Many of these mature supernova remnants contain still plasma with enhanced ejecta abundances. Over the last five years it has also become clear that many mixed-morphology remnants contain plasma that is overionized. This is in contrast to most other supernova remnants, which contain underionized plasmas. This text ends with a review of X-ray synchrotron radiation from shock regions, which has made it clear that some form of magnetic-field amplification is operating near shocks, and is an indication of efficient cosmic-ray acceleration.},

	Abstract = {We present X-ray images of Tycho's supernova remnant in emission-line features of Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, plus the continuum, using data obtained by the imaging spectrometers on board the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA). All the images show the shell-like morphology characteristic of previously obtained broadband X-ray images, but they are clearly distinct from each other. We use image reconstruction techniques to achieve a spatial resolution of ~0.8 arcmin. Line intensity ratios are used to make inferences about the remnant's physical state, on average for the entire remnant and with angular position around the rim. The average temperature of the Si and S ejecta in the remnant is (0.8-1.1) × 107 K, and the average ionization age is (0.8-1.3) × 1011 cm-3 s. For a constant ionization age, the observed relative brightness variations of Si and S line image profiles with azimuthal angle imply differences of roughly a factor of 1.3-1.8 in the temperature. We compare the radial brightness profiles of our images with simple geometrical models and find that a spherical emitting geometry is favored over a torus. A spherical geometry is further supported by the absence of systematic Doppler shifts across the remnant. The radial fit results also suggest that some radial mixing of the ejecta has occurred. However, the azimuthally averaged Fe K image peaks at a markedly lower radius than the other images. The average Fe K/Fe L line intensity ratio and the position of the Fe K energy centroid support a temperature several times higher and an ionization age approximately a factor of 10 lower than for the other elements, and imply that the Fe ejecta must have retained some of its stratification. Although many of the features in the 4-6 keV X-ray continuum correspond to those in the radio, there is no obvious correlation between the relative brightness in these bands.},

	Abstract = {The maximum energy for cosmic ray acceleration at supernova shock fronts is usually thought to be limited to around 1014-1015eV by the size of the shock and the time for which it propagates at high velocity. We show that the magnetic field can be amplified non-linearly by the cosmic rays to many times the pre-shock value, thus increasing the acceleration rate and facilitating acceleration to energies well above 1015eV. A supernova remnant expanding into a uniform circumstellar medium may accelerate protons to 1017eV and heavy ions, with charge Ze, to Z×1017eV. Expansion into a pre-existing stellar wind may increase the maximum cosmic ray energy by a further factor of 10.},

@article{uchiyama2007,
	Abstract = {Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are widely believed to be accelerated by shock waves associated with the expansion of supernova ejecta into the interstellar medium. A key issue in this long-standing conjecture is a theoretical prediction that the interstellar magnetic field can be substantially amplified at the shock of a young supernova remnant (SNR) through magnetohydrodynamic waves generated by cosmic rays. Here we report a discovery of the brightening and decay of X-ray hot spots in the shell of the SNR RXJ1713.7-3946 on a one-year timescale. This rapid variability shows that the X-rays are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons through a synchrotron process and that electron acceleration does indeed take place in a strongly magnetized environment, indicating amplification of the magnetic field by a factor of more than 100. The X-ray variability also implies that we have witnessed the ongoing shock-acceleration of electrons in real time. Independently, broadband X-ray spectrometric measurements of RXJ1713.7-3946 indicate that electron acceleration proceeds in the most effective (`Bohm-diffusion') regime. Taken together, these two results provide a strong argument for acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1PeV (1015eV) and beyond in young supernova remnants.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic rays are particles (mostly protons) accelerated to relativistic speeds. Despite wide agreement that supernova remnants (SNRs) are the sources of galactic cosmic rays, unequivocal evidence for the acceleration of protons in these objects is still lacking. When accelerated protons encounter interstellar material, they produce neutral pions, which in turn decay into gamma rays. This offers a compelling way to detect the acceleration sites of protons. The identification of pion-decay gamma rays has been difficult because high-energy electrons also produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering. We detected the characteristic pion-decay feature in the gamma-ray spectra of two SNRs, IC 443 and W44, with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. This detection provides direct evidence that cosmic-ray protons are accelerated in SNRs.},

	Abstract = {A significant fraction of the energy density of the interstellar medium is in the form of high-energy charged particles (cosmic rays). The origin of these particles remains uncertain. Although it is generally accepted that the only sources capable of supplying the energy required to accelerate the bulk of Galactic cosmic rays are supernova explosions, and even though the mechanism of particle acceleration in expanding supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is thought to be well understood theoretically, unequivocal evidence for the production of high-energy particles in supernova shells has proven remarkably hard to find. Here we report on observations of the SNR RX J1713.7 - 3946 (G347.3 - 0.5), which was discovered by ROSAT in the X-ray spectrum and later claimed as a source of high-energy gamma-rays of TeV energies (1TeV = 1012eV). We present a TeV gamma-ray image of the SNR: the spatially resolved remnant has a shell morphology similar to that seen in X-rays, which demonstrates that very-high-energy particles are accelerated there. The energy spectrum indicates efficient acceleration of charged particles to energies beyond 100TeV, consistent with current ideas of particle acceleration in young SNR shocks.},

@article{tanimori1998,
	Abstract = {In this Letter we report the discovery of TeV gamma-ray emission from a supernova remnant made with the CANGAROO 3.8 m telescope. TeV gamma rays were detected at the sky position and extension coincident with the northeast rim of shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006 (Type Ia). SN 1006 has been a most likely candidate for an extended TeV gamma-ray source, since the clear synchrotron X-ray emission from the rims was recently observed by ASCA (Koyama et al.), which is strong evidence for the existence of very high energy (up to hundreds of TeV) electrons in the SNR. The observed TeV gamma-ray flux was (2.4+/-0.5 [statistical]+/-0.7 [systematic])×10-12 cm-2 s-1 (>=3.0+/-0.9 TeV) and (4.6+/-0.6+/-1.4)×10-12 cm-2 s-1 (>=1.7+/-0.5 TeV) from the 1996 and 1997 observations, respectively. Also, we set an upper limit on the TeV gamma-ray emission from the southwest rim, which is estimated to be 1.1×10-12 cm-2 s-1 (>=1.7+/-0.5 TeV, 95% confidence level) in the 1997 data. The TeV gamma rays can be attributed to the 2.7 K cosmic background photons upscattered by electrons of energies up to about 1014 eV by the inverse Compton process. The observed flux of the TeV gamma rays, together with that of the nonthermal X-rays, gives firm constraints on the acceleration process in the SNR shell; a magnetic field of 6.5+/-2 muG is inferred from both the synchrotron X-rays and the inverse Compton TeV gamma rays, which provides entirely consistent evidence that electrons of energies up to 1014 eV are produced via shock acceleration in SN 1006.},

Methods: Deep observations at VHE energies (above 100 GeV) were carried out with the high energy stereoscopic system (HESS) of Cherenkov Telescopes from 2003 to 2008. More than 100 h of data have been collected and subjected to an improved analysis procedure.  Results: Observations resulted in the detection of VHE gamma-rays from SN 1006. The measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with a power-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the Crab Nebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established HESS upper limit. The source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlated with non-thermal X-rays.  Conclusions: Because the thickness of the VHE-shell is compatible with emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likely to be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. The measured flux level can be accounted for by inverse Compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includes leptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matter density inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description of the multi-wavelength spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Recent observations of non-thermal X-rays from supernova remnants have been attributed to synchrotron radiation from the loss-steepened tail of a non-thermal distribution of electrons accelerated at the remnant blast wave. In the test-particle limit of diffusive shock acceleration, in which the energy in shock-accelerated particles is unimportant, the slope of a shock-accelerated power-law is independent of the diffusion coefficient kappa and on how kappa depends on particle energy. However, the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated depends on the rate of acceleration and that does depend on the energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient. If the time to accelerate an electron from thermal energies to energy E>mec2 is tau(E) and if kappa~Ebeta, then tau(E)~Ebeta in parallel shocks and tau~E2-beta in perpendicular shocks. Most work on shock acceleration has made the plausible assumption that kappa~rg (where rg is the particle gyroradius), so that beta=1 at relativistic energies, implying a particular (wavelength-independent) spectrum of MHD turbulence, where Kolmogorov or Kraichnan spectra might be more physically plausible. I derive the beta dependence of the maximum electron energy resulting from limitations due to radiative (synchrotron and inverse-Compton) losses and to finite remnant age (or size). I then exhibit calculations of synchrotron X-ray spectra, and model images, for supernova remnants as a function of beta and compare to earlier beta=1 results. Spectra can be considerably altered for beta<1 and images are dramatically different for values of beta corresponding to Kolmogorov or Kraichnan spectra of turbulence. The predicted images are quite unlike observed remnants, suggesting that the turbulence near SNRs is generated by the high-energy particles themselves.},

	Abstract = {We propose that a nonthermal X-ray arc inside the remnant of Tycho's supernova (SN) represents the interaction between the SN ejecta and the companion star's envelope lost in the impact of the explosion. The X-ray emission of the remnant further shows an apparent shadow casted by the arc in the opposite direction of the explosion site, consistent with the blocking of the SN ejecta by the envelope. This scenario supports the single degenerate binary origin of Tycho's SN. The properties of the X-ray arc, together with the previous detection of the companion candidate and its space velocity by Ruiz-Lapuente et al. and Hern{\'a}ndez et al., enable us to further infer that (1) the progenitor binary has a period of 4.9+5.3 -3.0 days, (2) the companion gained a kick velocity of 42 $\pm$ 30 km s-1, and (3) the stripped envelope mass is about 0.0016 (<=0.0083) M sun. However, we note that the nature of the companion candidate is still under debate, and the above parameters need to be revised according to the actual properties of the companion candidate. Further work to measure the proper motion of the arc and to check the capability of the interaction to emit the amount of X-rays observed from the arc is also needed to validate the current scenario.},

	Abstract = {The large-scale magnetic field of our Galaxy can be probed in three dimensions using Faraday rotation of pulsar signals. We report on the determination of 223 rotation measures from polarization observations of relatively distant southern pulsars made using the Parkes radio telescope. Combined with previously published observations, these data give clear evidence for large-scale counterclockwise fields (viewed from the north Galactic pole) in the spiral arms interior to the Sun and weaker evidence for a counterclockwise field in the Perseus arm. However, in interarm regions, including the solar neighborhood, we present evidence that suggests that large-scale fields are clockwise. We propose that the large-scale Galactic magnetic field has a bisymmetric structure with reversals on the boundaries of the spiral arms. Streaming motions associated with spiral density waves can directly generate such a structure from an initial, inwardly directed radial field. Large-scale fields increase toward the Galactic center, with a mean value of about 2 muG in the solar neighborhood and 4 muG at a galactocentric radius of 3 kpc.},

	Abstract = {The nature and origin of turbulence and magnetic fields in the intergalactic space are important problems that are yet to be understood. We propose a scenario in which turbulent-flow motions are induced via the cascade of the vorticity generated at cosmological shocks during the formation of the large-scale structure. The turbulence in turn amplifies weak seed magnetic fields of any origin. Supercomputer simulations show that the turbulence is subsonic inside clusters and groups of galaxies, whereas it is transonic or mildly supersonic in filaments. Based on a turbulence dynamo model, we then estimated that the average magnetic field strength would be a few microgauss (muG) inside clusters and groups, approximately 0.1 muG around clusters and groups, and approximately 10 nanogauss in filaments. Our model presents a physical mechanism that transfers the gravitational energy to the turbulence and magnetic field energies in the large-scale structure of the universe.},

	Abstract = {Optical spectroscopic data are presented on the ionized nebulae associated with 14 galaxies that are strong far-IR emitters. It is found that the data provide both qualitative and quantitative support for the 'superwind' model in which the kinetic energy provided by SNe and winds from massive stars in a central starburst drives a large-scale outflow that can shock heat and accelerate ambient interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Clear kinematic signatures of an outflow along the galaxy's minor axis are found for the three nearest far-IR galaxies (FIRGs). The FIRG nebulae are highly overpressured relative to the Galactic ISM, with the pressure dropping systematically with distance from the nucleus. Superwinds are energetically adequate to power both the observed optical and X-ray nebulae, and the relative emission-line intensities and their radial variations are consistent with ionization by wind-driven shocks, but not with photoionization by normal O stars or an AGN. The possible astrophysical implications of superwinds are discussed.},

@article{miniati2000,
	Abstract = {We have examined the properties of shock waves in simulations of large-scale structure formation. Two cosmological scenarios have been considered: a standard cold dark matter model with OmegaM=1 (SCDM), and a cold dark matter model with cosmological constant and OmegaM+OmegaLambda=1 (LambdaCDM) having OmegaLambda=0.55. Large-scale shocks result from accretion onto sheets, filaments, and knots of mass distribution on a scale of the order of ~5 h-1 Mpc in both scenarios. Energetic motions, partly residuals of past accretion processes and partly caused by current asymmetric inflow along filaments, end up generating additional shocks. These extend on a scale of the order of ~1 h-1 Mpc and envelop and penetrate deep inside the clusters. Collisions between substructures inside clusters also form merger shocks. Consequently, the topology of the shocks is very complex and highly connected. During cosmic evolution the comoving shock surface density decreases, reflecting the ongoing structure merger process in both scenarios. Accretion shocks have very high Mach numbers, typically between 10 and a few ×103, when photoheating of the preshock gas is not included. The characteristic shock velocity is of the order of vsh(z)=H(z)lambdanl(z), where lambdanl(z) is the wavelength scale of the nonlinear perturbation at the given epoch. However, the Mach number for merger and flow shocks (which occur within clusters) is usually smaller, in the range of ~3-10, corresponding to the fact that the intracluster gas is hot (i.e., already shock heated). Statistical fits of shock velocities around clusters as a function of cluster temperature give power-law functions in accord with those predicted by one-dimensional solutions. On the other hand, a very different result is obtained for the shock radius, reflecting extremely complex shock structures surrounding clusters of galaxies in three-dimensional simulations. The amount of inflowing kinetic energy across the shocks around clusters, which represents the power available for cosmic-ray acceleration, is comparable to the cluster X-ray luminosity emitted from a central region of radius 0.5 h-1 Mpc. Considering their large size and long lifetimes, those shocks are potentially interesting sites for cosmic-ray acceleration, if modest magnetic fields exist within them.},

	Abstract = {The nature of the recently detected high-energy and very high-energy gamma-ray emission of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) is studied. A nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration in SNRs is employed to investigate the properties of Tycho's SNR and their correspondence with the existing experimental data, taking into account that the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) is expected to be clumpy. It is demonstrated that the overall steep gamma-ray spectrum observed can be interpreted as the superposition of two spectra produced by the CR proton component in two different ISM phases: the first gamma-ray component, extending up to about 1014 eV, originates in the diluted warm ISM, whereas the second component, extending up to 100 GeV, comes from numerous dense, small-scale clouds embedded in this warm ISM. Given the consistency between acceleration theory and the observed properties of the nonthermal emission of Tycho's SNR, very efficient production of nuclear CRs in Tycho's SNR is established. The excess of the GeV gamma-ray emission due to the clouds' contribution above the level expected in the case of a purely homogeneous ISM is inevitably expected in the case of Type Ia SNe.},

	Abstract = {Context. Very recent gamma-ray observations of G120.1+1.4 (Tycho's) supernova remnant (SNR) by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS have provided new fundamental pieces of information for understanding particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in SNRs.  Aims: We want to outline a coherent description of Tycho's properties in terms of SNR evolution, shock hydrodynamics, and multiwavelength emission by accounting for particle acceleration at the forward shock via first-order Fermi mechanism.  Methods: We adopt here a quick and reliable semi-analytical approach to nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration. It includes magnetic field amplification due to resonant streaming instability and the dynamical backreaction on the shock of both cosmic rays (CRs) and self-generated magnetic turbulence.  Results: We find that Tycho's forward shock accelerates protons up to at least 500 TeV, channelling into CRs about 10% of its kinetic energy. Moreover, the CR-induced streaming instability is consistent with all the observational evidence of very efficient magnetic field amplification (up to ~300 muG). In such a strong magnetic field, the velocity of the Alfv{\'e}n waves scattering CRs in the upstream is expected to be enhanced and to make accelerated particles feel an effective compression factor lower than 4, in turn leading to an energy spectrum steeper than the standard prediction ∝ E-2. This effect is crucial for explaining GeV-to-TeV gamma-ray spectrum as the result of neutral pions decay produced in nuclear collisions between accelerated nuclei and the background gas.  Conclusions: The self-consistency of such hadronic scenario, along with the inability of the concurrent leptonic mechanism (inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons on several photon backgrounds) to reproduce both the shape and the normalization of the detected gamma-ray emission, represents the first clear and direct radiative evidence that hadron acceleration occurs efficiently in young Galactic SNRs.},

Observations performed in the period 2008-2010 with the VERITAS ground-based gamma-ray observatory reveal weak emission coming from the direction of the remnant, compatible with a point source located at 00h25m27.s0, + 64$\,^{\circ}$10'50'' (J2000). The TeV photon spectrum measured by VERITAS can be described with a power law dN/dE = C(E/3.42 TeV)-Gamma with Gamma = 1.95 $\pm$ 0.51stat $\pm$ 0.30sys and C = (1.55 $\pm$ 0.43stat $\pm$ 0.47sys) × 10-14 cm-2 s-1 TeV-1. The integral flux above 1 TeV corresponds to ~0.9% of the steady Crab Nebula emission above the same energy, making it one of the weakest sources yet detected in TeV gamma rays. We present both leptonic and hadronic models that can describe the data. The lowest magnetic field allowed in these models is ~80 muG, which may be interpreted as evidence for magnetic field amplification.},

	Abstract = {We employ hydrodynamic simulations to study the effects of high shock compression ratios, as expected for fast shocks with efficient particle acceleration, on the convective instability of driven waves in supernova remnants. We find that the instability itself does not depend significantly on the compression ratio, sigma, with the growth rates and the width of the mixing region at saturation being comparable for the range of ratios we studied; 4<=sigma<=21. However, because the width of the interaction region between the forward and reverse shocks can shrink significantly with increasing sigma, we find that convective instabilities can reach all the way to the forward shock front if compression ratios are high enough. Thus, if supernova blast waves accelerate particles efficiently, we expect the forward shock to be perturbed with small-amplitude, small-wavelength bumps and to find clumps and filaments of dense ejecta material in the vicinity of the shock. In addition and in contrast to situations in which sigma<=4, any enhancement of the radial magnetic field from Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities will also extend all the way to the shock front, and this may help explain the slight dominance of radial fields long seen in polarization measurements of young remnants like Tycho.},

	Abstract = {Among the various acceleration mechanisms which have been suggested as responsible for the nonthermal particle spectra and associated radiation observed in many astrophysical and space physics environments, diffusive shock acceleration appears to be the most successful. We review the current theoretical understanding of this process, from the basic ideas of how a shock energizes a few reactionless particles to the advanced nonlinear approaches treating the shock and accelerated particles as a symbiotic self-organizing system. By means of direct solution of the nonlinear problem we set the limit to the test-particle approximation and demonstrate the fundamental role of nonlinearity in shocks of astrophysical size and lifetime. We study the bifurcation of this system, proceeding from the hydrodynamic to kinetic description under a realistic condition of Bohm diffusivity. We emphasize the importance of collective plasma phenomena for the global flow structure and acceleration efficiency by considering the injection process, an initial stage of acceleration and, the related aspects of the physics of collisionless shocks. We calculate the injection rate for different shock parameters and different species. This, together with differential acceleration resulting from nonlinear large-scale modification, determines the chemical composition of accelerated particles. The review concentrates on theoretical and analytical aspects but our strategic goal is to link the fundamental theoretical ideas with the rapidly growing wealth of observational data.},

	Abstract = {A number of supernova remnants (SNRs) show nonthermal X-rays assumed to be synchrotron emission from shock accelerated TeV electrons. The existence of these TeV electrons strongly suggests that the shocks in SNRs are sources of galactic cosmic rays (CRs). In addition, there is convincing evidence from broad-band studies of individual SNRs and elsewhere that the particle acceleration process in SNRs can be efficient and nonlinear. If SNR shocks are efficient particle accelerators, the production of CRs impacts the thermal properties of the shock heated, X-ray emitting gas and the SNR evolution. We report on a technique that couples nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration, including the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the structure of the forward and reverse shocks, with a hydrodynamic simulation of SNR evolution. Compared to models which ignore CRs, the most important hydrodynamical effects of placing a significant fraction of shock energy into CRs are larger shock compression ratios and lower temperatures in the shocked gas. We compare our results, which use an approximate description of the acceleration process, with a more complete model where the full CR transport equations are solved \citep[i.e.,][]{BKV2002}, and find excellent agreement for the CR spectrum summed over the SNR lifetime and the evolving shock compression ratio. The importance of the coupling between particle acceleration and SNR dynamics for the interpretation of broad-band continuum and thermal X-ray observations is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at collisionless astrophysical shock fronts is reviewed. Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfv{\'e}n waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfv{\'e}n waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},

	Abstract = {Synchrotron X-rays can be a useful tool to investigate electron acceleration at young supernova remnants (SNRs). At present, since the magnetic field configuration around the shocks of SNRs is uncertain, it is not clear whether electron acceleration is limited by SNR age, synchrotron cooling, or even escape from the acceleration region. We study whether the acceleration mechanism can be constrained by the cutoff shape of the electron spectrum around the maximum energy. We derive analytical formulae of the cutoff shape in each case where the maximum electron energy is determined by SNR age, synchrotron cooling and escape from the shock. They are related to the energy dependence of the electron diffusion coefficient. Next, we discuss whether information on the cutoff shape can be provided by observations in the near future which will simply give the photon indices and the flux ratios in the soft and hard X-ray bands. We find that if the power-law index of the electron spectrum is independently determined by other observations, then we can constrain the cutoff shape by comparing theoretical predictions of the photon indices and/or the flux ratios with observed data which will be measured by NuSTAR and/or ASTRO-H. Such study is helpful in understanding the acceleration mechanism. In particular, it will supply another independent constraint on the magnetic field strength around the shocks of SNRs.},

	Abstract = {Recent observations with the ASCA satellite (Koyama et al. 1995) have finally settled the question of the nature of the X-ray spectrum from the remnant of the supernova of 1006 AD. The bright rims have a featureless power-law spectrum while fainter parts of the remnant show a normal thermal spectrum with the expected lines. I describe model images and spectra that fit the data from the bright rims well, on the premise that the X-rays are synchrotron emission from electrons with energies up to 100 TeV accelerated in the remnant blast wave. The maximum energy to which electrons can be accelerated is limited by the requirement that the acceleration time be less than the smaller of the remnant age or the electrons' radiative loss time. In addition, absence of magnetohydrodynamic waves with sufficiently long wavelength to scatter electrons above some energy would allow electrons to escape freely above that energy, rather than being further accelerated. The maximum energy is thus a function of time and position. I assume that the electron mean free path is proportional to gyroradius, with proportionality constant f. With no internal magnetic field amplification beyond the original shock compression, the observed morphology, spectral shape, and X-ray flux at 4 keV can be fitted well with two models, one with escape, and the other with a perhaps unreasonably low upstream magnetic field. The former model has an external magnetic field strength of 3 mu G, f = 10, and a maximum MHD wavelength of 1017 cm. The latter, no-escape model has an external magnetic field strength of 0.6 mu G and f = 1. Both models predict upstream emission at a level of a few percent of postshock emission, but with differing morphologies. Models with an upstream magnetic field of 3 mu G and without escape overpredict X-rays at 4 keV by over an order of magnitude.},

The interstellar medium around the remnant was surveyed using high-resolution (~13") VLA archive observations in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. We have found cold, dense gas at kinematic velocities compatible with the SNR, in excellent agreement with the locations where, based on earlier proper-motion expansion studies of the synchrotron emission, the shock front is expanding more slowly than most of the SNR shell. The site of lowest expansion velocity along the whole shell is coincident with a small H I clump observed as an absorption feature at v=-51.5 km s^-1, with a density in the range 160-325 cm^-3. The clump seems to have been intercepted by the shock front in the recent past and has not yet undergone significant evaporation. Toward the western side of the SNR shell, which morphologically preserves spherical symmetry and expands at a higher rate, no H I features have been observed. We conclude that the presence of dense concentrations toward the east is currently slowing down the expansion of the shock front locally. These observations demonstrate that the properties of the local interstellar medium can affect the dynamical evolution of SNRs even at early stages.},

Assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc to Tycho's remnant, we obtain values for the CR diffusion coefficient, kappa, the injection parameter, epsilon, and the timescale for the energy transfer, tau, of kappa = 2 × 1024 cm2 s-1, epsilon = 4.2 × 10-3, and tau = 426 yr, respectively. We have also studied the parameter space for fast (300 km s-1 lsim vs lsim 3000 km s-1), time-asymptotically steady shocks and have identified a branch of solutions, for which the temperature in the CR precursor typically reaches 2 × 104 to 6 × 104 K and the bulk acceleration of the flow through the precursor is less than 10 km s-1. These solutions fall into the low CR acceleration efficiency regime and are relatively insensitive to shock parameters. This low CR acceleration efficiency branch of solutions may provide a natural explanation for the line broadening of the Halpha narrow component observed in nonradiative shocks in many SNRs.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method of determining the systemic velocity of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) based on H I absorption of their linearly polarized radio continuum emission. Conventional H I observations of total power emission are limited by H I emission and self-absorption along the line of sight, but since H I emission is unpolarized, the only limits on measurements of absorption of the polarized emission are noise and velocity resolution. This leads to lower uncertainties and makes it possible to obtain absorption profiles for virtually all Galactic SNRs with very precise H I column densities. To demonstrate the new technique, we have obtained H I absorption profiles from Tycho's supernova remnant (G120.1+1.4). Absorption profiles of the polarized emission are very similar to those of the total power emission. Optical depths from the polarization profiles are slightly larger because of small-scale emission features. We also observed polarization absorption profiles of the Boomerang pulsar wind nebula (part of G106.3+2.7) and the plerionic SNR DA 495 (G65.7+1.2), remnants that are so faint that absorption profiles cannot be obtained in total power.},

	Abstract = {The historical supernova remnant (SNR) Tycho SN 1572 originates from the explosion of a normal Type Ia supernova that is believed to have originated from a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a binary system. We analyze the 21 cm continuum, H I, and 12CO-line data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey in the direction of SN 1572 and the surrounding region. We construct H I absorption spectra to SN 1572 and three nearby compact sources. We conclude that SN 1572 has no molecular cloud interaction, which argues against previous claims that a molecular cloud is interacting with the SNR. This new result does not support a recent claim that dust, newly detected by AKARI, originates from such an SNR-cloud interaction. We suggest that the SNR has a kinematic distance of 2.5-3.0 kpc based on a nonlinear rotational curve model. Very high energy gamma-ray emission from the remnant has been detected by the VERITAS telescope, so our result shows that its origin should not be an SNR-cloud interaction. Both radio and X-ray observations support that SN 1572 is an isolated Type Ia SNR.},

	Abstract = {Context: The density of the ambient medium where the supernova remnant evolves is a relevant parameter for its hydrodynamical evolution, for the mechanism of particle acceleration, and for the emission at TeV energies.  Aims: Using XMM-Newton X-ray observations, we present a study of the ambient medium density of the historical supernova remnant SN 1006.   Methods: We modelled the post-shock thermal emission to constrain the ambient medium density. Our study is focused on the North-West and the South-East rims of the remnant, where the thermal emission dominates. We used a plane-parallel shock plasma model plus another component for the ejecta that are not negligible in the regions of our study. The importance of the synchrotron component is also studied. In order to improve statistics, we combined several observations of the remnant.  Results: The density found in the South-East rim is low, roughly 0.05 cm-3, and seems to be representative of the rest of the remnant. However, in the North-West rim (close to the bright optical filament), the density is significantly higher (about 0.15-0.25 cm-3). This confirms a picture of SN 1006 evolving in a tenuous ambient medium, except in the North-West where the remnant has recently encountered a denser region. Conclusions: A density this low is compatible with the non-detection of the remnant by the HESS gamma-ray observatory. The lower density in the South-East implies a higher shock speed of 4900 km s-1, higher than that of 2890 km s-1 measured in the North-West. This new estimate of the velocity could increase the maximum energy that accelerated particles can reach to energies of about 1 PeV.},

	Abstract = {Broadband optical and narrowband Si XIII X-ray images of the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) obtained over several decades are used to investigate spatial and temporal emission correlations on both large and small angular scales. The data examined consist of optical and near-infrared ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope images taken between 1951 and 2011, and of X-ray images from Einstein, ROSAT, and Chandra taken between 1979 and 2013. We find weak spatial correlations between the remnant's X-ray and optical emission features on large scales, but several cases of good optical/X-ray correlations on small scales for features which have brightened due to recent interactions with the reverse shock. We also find instances (1) where a time delay is observed between the appearance of a feature's optical and X-ray emissions, (2) of displacements of several arcseconds between a feature's X-ray and optical emission peaks, and (3) of regions showing no corresponding X-ray or optical emissions. To explain this behavior, we propose a highly inhomogeneous density model for Cas A's ejecta consisting of small, dense optically emitting knots (n ~102-3 cm--3) and a much lower density (n ~0.1-1 cm--3) diffuse X-ray emitting component often spatially associated with optical emission knots. The X-ray emitting component is sometimes linked to optical clumps through shock-induced mass ablation generating trailing material leading to spatially offset X-ray/optical emissions. A range of ejecta densities can also explain the observed X-ray/optical time delays since the remnant's ≈5000 km s--1 reverse shock heats dense ejecta clumps to temperatures around 3 × 104 K relatively quickly, which then become optically bright while more diffuse ejecta become X-ray bright on longer timescales. Highly inhomogeneous ejecta as proposed here for Cas A may help explain some of the X-ray/optical emission features seen in other young core-collapse supernova remnants.},

We interpret these results in the context of hydrodynamical models for the evolution of the remnant. The distributions of fitted temperature and ionization age, and the implied mass coordinates, are highly peaked and suggest that the ejecta were subjected to multiple secondary shocks following reverse shock interaction with ejecta inhomogeneities. Based on the fitted emission measure and element abundances, and an estimate of the emitting volume, we derive masses for the X-ray-emitting ejecta and also show the distribution of the mass of various elements over the remnant. An upper limit to the total shocked Fe mass visible in X-rays appears to be roughly 0.13 M &sun;, which accounts for nearly all of the mass expected in Fe ejecta. We find two populations of Fe ejecta, that associated with normal Si burning and that possibly associated with alpha-rich freezeout, with a mass ratio of approximately 2:1. Essentially all of the observed Fe (both components) lies well outside the central regions of the SNR, possibly having been ejected by hydrodynamic instabilities during the explosion. We discuss this and its implications for the neutron star kick.},

	Abstract = {We present Chandra X-ray images of Tycho's supernova remnant that delineate its outer shock as a thin, smooth rim along the straight northeastern edge and most of the circular western half. The images also show that the Si and S ejecta are highly clumpy and have reached near the forward shock at numerous locations. Most of the X-ray spectra that we examine along the rim show evidence of line emission from Si and S ejecta, while the continuum is well represented by either a thermal or a nonthermal model. If the continuum is assumed to be thermal, the electron temperatures at the rim are all similar at about 2 keV, while the ionization ages are very low because of the overall weakness of the line emission. These electron temperatures are substantially below those expected for equilibration of the electron and ion temperatures, assuming shock velocities inferred from radio and X-ray expansion measurements; the electron-to-mean temperature ratios are <~0.1-0.2, indicating that collisionless heating of the electrons at the shock is modest. The nonthermal contribution to these spectra might be important, but cannot be strongly constrained by these data. It could account for as much as half of the flux in the 4-6 keV energy range, based on an extrapolation of the hard X-ray spectrum above 10 keV.},

	Abstract = {We report the localization of the forward and reverse shock fronts in the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using X-ray data obtained with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. High-resolution X-ray maps resolve a previously unseen X-ray feature encompassing the extremity of the remnant. This feature consists of thin, tangential wisps of emission bordering the outer edge of the thermal X-ray and radio remnant, forming a circular rim, ~2.7' in radius. Radio images show a sharp rise in brightness at this X-ray rim along with a large jump in the synchrotron polarization angle. These characteristics suggest that these wisps are the previously unresolved signature of the forward, or outer, shock. Similarly, we identify the sharp rise in emissivity of the bright shell for both the radio and X-ray line emission associated with the reverse shock. The derived ratio of the averaged forward and reverse shock radii of ~3:2 constrains the remnant to have swept up roughly the same amount of mass as was ejected; this suggests that Cas A is just entering the Sedov phase. Comparison of the X-ray spectra from the two shock regions shows that the equivalent widths of prominent emission lines are significantly lower exterior to the bright shell, as expected if they are respectively identified with the shocked circumstellar material and shocked ejecta. Furthermore, the spectrum of the outer rim itself is dominated by power-law emission, likely the counterpart of the nonthermal component previously seen at energies above ~10 keV.},

	Abstract = {Characteristic scale lengths of nonthermal X-rays from the SN 1006 NE rim, which are observed by Chandra, are interpreted in the context of diffusive shock acceleration with the assumption that the observed spatial profile of nonthermal X-rays corresponds to that of accelerated electrons with energies of a few tens of TeV. To explain the observed scale lengths, we construct two simple models with a test particle approximation, where the maximum energy of accelerated electrons is determined by the age of SN 1006 (age-limited model) or the energy loss (energy loss-limited model), and constrain the magnetic field configuration and the diffusion coefficients of accelerated electrons. When the magnetic field is nearly parallel to the shock normal, the magnetic field should be in the range of 20-85 muG and highly turbulent both upstream and downstream, which means that the mean free path of accelerated electrons is of the order of their gyro-radius (Bohm limit). This situation can be realized both in the age-limited and energy loss-limited model. On the other hand, when the magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the shock normal, which can exist only in the age-limited case, the magnetic field is several muG upstream and 14-20 muG downstream, and the upstream magnetic field is less turbulent than the downstream.},

The shell region spectra are in general represented by an optically thin thermal plasma emission in collisional ionization equilibrium with a temperature of ˜ 0.3 keV and a density of ˜ 10 cm-3, which is much higher than the density obtained for inner parts. In contrast, we detected no significant X-ray flux from one of the TeV gamma-ray peaks with an upper-limit flux of 2.1 × 10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 2-10 keV band. The large flux ratio of TeV to X-ray, larger than 16, and the spatial coincidence of the molecular cloud and the TeV gamma-ray emission site indicate that the TeV gamma-ray of W 28 is pi0-decay emission originating from collisions between accelerated protons and molecular cloud protons. Comparing the spectrum in the TeV band and the X-ray upper limit, we obtained a weak upper limit on the magnetic field strength B ≲ 1500 muG.},

	Abstract = {The shocks of supernova remnants are believed to accelerate particles to cosmic ray (CR) energies. The amplification of the magnetic field due to CRs propagating in the shock region is expected to have an impact on both the emission from the accelerated particle population as well as the acceleration process itself. Using a 95 ks observation with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, we map and characterize the synchrotron emitting material in the northwest region of RCW 86. We model spectra from several different regions, both filamentary and diffuse, where emission appears to be dominated by synchrotron radiation. The fine spatial resolution of Chandra allows us to obtain accurate emission profiles across three different non-thermal rims in this region. The narrow width (l ≈ 10''-30'') of these filaments constrains the minimum magnetic field strength at the post-shock region to approximately 80 muG.},

	Abstract = {Context. Observation of Balmer lines from the region around the forward shock of supernova remnants (SNRs) may provide valuable information on the shock dynamics and the efficiency of particle acceleration at the shock.  Aims: We calculated the Balmer line emission and the shape of the broad Balmer line for parameter values suitable for SNR RCW 86 (G315.4 - 2.3) as a function of the cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and of the level of thermal equilibration between electrons and protons behind the shock. This calculation aims at using the width of the broad Balmer-line emission to infer the CR acceleration efficiency in this remnant.  Methods: We used the recently developed non linear theory of diffusive shock-acceleration in the presence of neutrals. The semianalytical approach we developed includes a description of magnetic field amplification as due to resonant streaming instability, the dynamical reaction of accelerated particles and the turbulent magnetic field on the shock, and all channels of interaction between neutral hydrogen atoms and background ions that are relevant for the shock dynamics.  Results: We derived the CR acceleration efficiency in the SNR RCW 86 from the Balmer emission. Since our calculation used recent measurements of the shock proper motion, the results depend on the assumed distance to Earth. For a distance of 2 kpc the measured width of the broad Balmer line is compatible with the absence of CR acceleration. For a distance of 2.5 kpc, which is a widely used value in current literature, a CR acceleration efficiency of 5-30% is obtained, depending upon the electron-ion equilibration and the ionization fraction upstream of the shock. By combining information on Balmer emission with the measured value of the downstream electron temperature, we constrain the CR acceleration efficiency to be ~20%.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic rays are the most energetic particles arriving at Earth. Although most of them are thought to be accelerated by supernova remnants, the details of the acceleration process and its efficiency are not well determined. Here we show that the pressure induced by cosmic rays exceeds the thermal pressure behind the northeast shock of the supernova remnant RCW 86, where the x-ray emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation from ultrarelativistic electrons. We determined the cosmic-ray content from the thermal Doppler broadening measured with optical spectroscopy, combined with a proper-motion study in x-rays. The measured postshock proton temperature, in combination with the shock velocity, does not agree with standard shock heating, implying that >50% of the postshock pressure is produced by cosmic rays.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis that sheetlike shock fronts propagating into large clouds immersed in a fairly uniform intercloud medium can provide a consistent picture accounting for essentially all the observational data for the Cygnus Loop SNR is considered. Filaments are interpreted as line-of-sight projections of portions of the sheet. Variations in the projection of the shock velocity along the line of sight lead naturally to 'turbulent' velocities consistent with observation. An analog model of a large, distorted, bumpy shock front is presented and shown to produce the observed morphology of the remnant's prominent optical filaments. Comparison with the observed morphology supports the idea that regions of optical emission lie on the local outer boundary of the shell and have not been engulfed by the blast wave. Bright X-ray emission arises when the blast wave encounters a preshock medium with an intermediate density higher than average for the adiabatic portion of the remnant, but still lower than that required for the shock to become radiative.},

	Abstract = {We present narrowband images of the Kepler supernova remnant obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The images, with an angular resolution of 0.05'', reveal the structure of the emitting gas in unprecedented detail. Radiative and nonradiative shocks are found in close proximity, unresolvable in ground-based spectra, indicating that the pre-shock medium is highly clumped. The ionization structure, traced by differences in the [O III] to [N II] flux ratio, varies on subarcsecond scales. The variation is due to both differences in shock velocity and gradients in the evolutionary stage of the shocks. A prominent complex of knots protruding beyond the boundary of the remnant in the northwest is found to consist of bright radiative knots, connected by arcuate nonradiative filaments. Based on the coincidence of the optical emission with a bright isolated knot of X-ray emission, we infer that this feature is due to a Rayleigh-Taylor finger that formed at the contact discontinuity and overtook the primary blastwave.},

	Abstract = {The X-ray structure of Kepler's supernova remnant shows a rounded shape delineated by forward shocks. We measure proper motions of the forward shocks on overall rims of the remnant, by using archival Chandra data taken in two epochs with time difference of 6.09 yr. The proper motions of the forward shocks on the northern rim are measured to be 0.076" (+/-0.032" +/-0.016") to 0.11" (+/-0.014" +/-0.016") yr-1, while those on the rest of the rims are measured to be 0.15" (+/-0.017" +/-0.016") to 0.30" (+/-0.048" +/-0.016") yr-1 here the first-term errors are statistical uncertainties and the second-term errors are systematic uncertainties. Combining the best-estimated shock velocity of 1660+/-120 km s-1 measured for Balmer-dominated filaments in the northern and central portions of the remnant (Sankrit et al. 2005) with the proper motions derived for the forward shocks on the northern rim, we estimate a distance of 3.3+1.6-0.4 kpc to the remnant. We measure the expansion indices, m (defined as R~tm), to be 0.47-0.82 for most of the rims. These values are consistent with those expected in Type Ia SN explosion models, in which the ejecta and the circumstellar medium have power-law density profiles whose indices are 5-7 and 0-2, respectively. In addition, we should note the slower expansion on the northern rim than that on the southern rim. This is likely caused by the inhomogeneous circumstellar medium; the density of the circumstellar medium is higher in the north than that in the south of the remnant. The newly estimated geometric center, around which we believe the explosion point exists, is located at ~5" offset to the north of the radio center.},

We describe a statistical technique for isolating X-ray emission due to CSM from that due to shocked ejecta. Shocked CSM coincides well in position with 24 mum emission seen by Spitzer. We find most CSM to be distributed along the bright north rim, but substantial concentrations are also found projected against the center of the remnant, roughly along a diameter with position angle ~100$\,^{\circ}$. We interpret this as evidence for a disk distribution of CSM before the supernova, with the line of sight to the observer roughly in the disk plane. We present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of this scenario in qualitative agreement with the observed CSM morphology. Our observations require Kepler to have originated in a close binary system with an asymptotic giant branch star companion.},

@article{williams2012,
	Abstract = {Characterization of the relatively poorly understood progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae is of great importance in astrophysics, particularly given the important cosmological role that these supernovae play. Kepler's supernova remnant, the result of a Type Ia supernova, shows evidence for an interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), suggesting a single-degenerate progenitor system. We present 7.5-38 mum infrared (IR) spectra of the remnant, obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, dominated by emission from warm dust. Broad spectral features at 10 and 18 mum, consistent with various silicate particles, are seen throughout. These silicates were likely formed in the stellar outflow from the progenitor system during the asymptotic giant branch stage of evolution, and imply an oxygen-rich chemistry. In addition to silicate dust, a second component, possibly carbonaceous dust, is necessary to account for the short-wavelength Infrared Spectrograph and Infrared Array Camera data. This could imply a mixed chemistry in the atmosphere of the progenitor system. However, non-spherical metallic iron inclusions within silicate grains provide an alternative solution. Models of collisionally heated dust emission from fast shocks (>1000 km s-1) propagating into the CSM can reproduce the majority of the emission associated with non-radiative filaments, where dust temperatures are ~80-100 K, but fail to account for the highest temperatures detected, in excess of 150 K. We find that slower shocks (a few hundred km s-1) into moderate density material (n 0 ~ 50-250 cm-3) are the only viable source of heating for this hottest dust. We confirm the finding of an overall density gradient, with densities in the north being an order of magnitude greater than those in the south.},

The strength and prominence of iron emission, together with the absence of O-rich ejecta, demonstrate that Kepler resulted from a thermonuclear supernova, even though evidence for circumstellar interaction is also strong. We have analyzed spectra of over 100 small regions, and find that they fall into three classes. (1) The vast majority show Fe L emission between 0.7 and 1 keV and Si and S Kalpha emission; we associate these with shocked ejecta. A few of these are found at or beyond the mean blast wave radius. (2) A very few regions show solar O/Fe abundance ratios; these we associate with shocked circumstellar medium (CSM). Otherwise O is scarce. (3) A few regions are dominated by continuum, probably synchrotron radiation. Finally, we find no central point source, with a limit ~100 times fainter than the central object in Cas A. The evidence that the blast wave is interacting with CSM may indicate a Ia explosion in a more massive progenitor.},

	Abstract = {The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the related F-test, popularized in astrophysics by Eadie and coworkers in 1971, Bevington in 1969, Lampton, Margon, & Bowyer, in 1976, Cash in 1979, and Avni in 1978, do not (even asymptotically) adhere to their nominal chi2 and F-distributions in many statistical tests common in astrophysics, thereby casting many marginal line or source detections and nondetections into doubt. Although the above authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary to common practice, the nominal chi2 distribution for the LRT or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases of the inappropriate use of the LRT and similar tests in the literature, bringing substantive scientific results into question.},

	Abstract = {We show that the expansion of ejecta in Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) is consistent with a spherically symmetric shell, based on Suzaku measurements of the Doppler broadened X-ray emission lines. All of the strong Kalpha line emissions show broader widths at the center than at the rim, while the centroid energies are constant across the remnant (except for Ca). This is the pattern expected for Doppler broadening due to expansion of the SNR ejecta in a spherical shell. To determine the expansion velocities of the ejecta, we applied a model for each emission-line feature having two Gaussian components separately representing red- and blueshifted gas, and inferred the Doppler velocity difference between these two components directly from the fitted centroid energy difference. Taking into account the effect of projecting a three-dimensional shell to the plane of the detector, we derived average spherical expansion velocities independently for the Kalpha emission of Si, S, Ar, and Fe, and Kbeta of Si. We found that the expansion velocities of Si, S, and Ar ejecta of 4700 $\pm$ 100 km s-1 are distinctly higher than that obtained from Fe Kalpha emission, 4000 $\pm$ 300 km s-1, which is consistent with segregation of the Fe in the inner ejecta. Combining the observed ejecta velocities with the ejecta proper-motion measurements by Chandra, we derived a distance to Tycho's SNR of 4 $\pm$ 1 kpc.},

Models of diffusive shock acceleration suggest that in shocks that occur during cluster mergers, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, similar to conditions within supernova remnants. In the presence of magnetic fields, these particles emit synchrotron radiation and may form so-called radio relics. We detected a radio relic that displays highly aligned magnetic fields, a strong spectral index gradient, and a narrow relic width, giving a measure of the magnetic field in an unexplored site of the universe. Our observations show that diffusive shock acceleration also operates on scales much larger than in supernova remnants and that shocks in galaxy clusters are capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays.},

@article{reynolds1999,
	Abstract = {Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are often assumed to be the source of cosmic rays up to energies approaching the slight steepening in the cosmic-ray spectrum at around 1000 TeV, known as the ``knee.'' We show that the observed X-ray emission of 14 radio-bright shell remnants, including all five historical shells, can be used to put limits on Emax, the energy at which the electron energy distribution must steepen from its slope at radio-emitting energies. Most of the remnants show thermal spectra, so any synchrotron component must fall below the observed X-ray fluxes. We obtain upper limits on Emax by considering the most rapid physically plausible cutoff in the relativistic electron distribution, an exponential, which is as sharp or sharper than found in any more elaborate models. This maximally curved model then gives us the highest possible Emax consistent with not exceeding observed X-rays. Our results are thus independent of particular models for the electron spectrum in SNRs. Assuming homogeneous emitting volumes with a constant magnetic field strength of 10 muG, no object could reach 1000 TeV, and only one, Kes 73, has an upper limit on Emax above 100 TeV. All the other remnants have limits at or below 80 TeV. Emax is probably set by the finite remnant lifetime rather than by synchrotron losses for remnants younger than a few thousand years, so that an observed electron steepening should be accompanied by steepening at the same energy for protons. More complicated, inhomogeneous models could allow higher values of Emax in parts of the remnant, but the emission-weighted average value, that characteristic of typical electrons, should obey these limits. The young remnants are not expected to improve much over their remaining lives at producing the highest energy Galactic cosmic rays; if they cannot, this picture of cosmic-ray origin may need major alteration.},

	Abstract = {I have determined the expansion of the supernova remnant of SN 1604 (Kepler's supernova) based on archival Chandra ACIS-S observations made in 2000 and 2006. The measurements were done in several distinct energy bands, and were made for the remnant as a whole, and for six individual sectors. The average expansion parameter indicates that the remnant expands on average as r~t0.5, but there are significant differences in different parts of the remnant: the bright northwestern part expands as r~t0.35, whereas the rest of the remnant's expansion shows an expansion r~t0.6. The latter is consistent with an explosion in which the outer part of the ejecta has a negative power law slope for density (rho~v-n) of n=7, or with an exponential density profile [rho~exp(-v/ve)]. The expansion parameter in the southern region, in conjunction with the shock radius, indicates a rather low value (<5×1050 erg) for the explosion energy of SN 1604 for a distance of 4 kpc. A higher explosion energy is consistent with the results if the distance is larger. The filament in the eastern part of the remnant, which is dominated by X-ray synchrotron radiation, seems to mark a region with a fast shock speed r~t0.7, corresponding to a shock velocity of v=4200 km s-1, for a distance to SN 1604 of 4 kpc. This is consistent with the idea that X-ray synchrotron emission requires shock velocities in excess of ~2000 km s-1. The X-ray-based expansion measurements reported are consistent with results based on optical and radio measurements but disagree with previous X-ray measurements based on ROSAT and Einstein observations.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the nonthermal X-ray emission from Cas A, using BeppoSAX, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory OSSE, and Chandra data. For the hard X-ray continuum we test the model proposed by Laming, which invokes nonthermal bremsstrahlung from electrons accelerated by lower hybrid plasma waves. The justification for this model comes from our determination of a lower limit to the average magnetic field of B>0.5 mG. For such high magnetic fields, the synchrotron losses are severe enough that most of the electron populations responsible for the radio emission have maximum electron energies well below the limit for which X-ray synchrotron emission is important. However, we do suggest that the rim surrounding Cas A, seen in Chandra continuum images, is X-ray synchrotron emission. The width of this rim of 1.5"-4" can be used to infer the magnetic field near the shock front, for which we estimate B=0.08-0.16 mG and electron energies of ~57-40 TeV. This magnetic field strength is lower than the average magnetic field but higher than what may be expected from shocked interstellar medium, suggesting either a high magnetic field in the wind of the progenitor or rapid postshock field amplification by nonlinear growth of plasma waves. Combining the two magnetic field measurements, we have constructed a simple two-zone model. Most of the radio emission comes from inside Cas A, where the magnetic field is strong. In contrast, the inverse Compton emission is dominated by emission from near the shock front. Only for our lower limit on the magnetic field strength near the shock front is it possible to explain the recent detection of TeV emission by the High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy experiment with inverse Compton emission, for which, in addition, we have to assume a rather high far-infrared photon density that should be twice as high as our best estimate of ~70 cm-3. Pion decay is therefore likely to be the dominant emission from Cas A at TeV energies.},

@article{volk2005,
	Abstract = {It is shown that amplification of the magnetic field in supernova remnants (SNRs) occurs in all six objects where morphological measurements are presently available in the hard X-ray continuum at several keV. For the three archetypical objects (SN 1006, Cas A and Tycho's SNR) to which nonlinear time-dependent acceleration theory has been successfully applied up to now, the global theoretical and the local observational field strengths agree very well, suggesting in addition that all young SNRs exhibit the amplification effect as a result of very efficient acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays (CRs) at the outer shock. Since this appears to be empirically the case, we may reverse the argument and consider field amplification as a measure of nuclear CR acceleration and it has indeed been argued that acceleration in the amplified fields allows the CR spectrum from SNRs to reach the knee in the spectrum or, in special objects, even beyond. The above results are furthermore used to investigate the time evolution of field amplification in young SNRs. Although the uncertainties in the data do not allow precise conclusions regarding this point, they rather clearly show that the ratio of the magnetic field energy density and the kinetic energy density of gas flow into the shock is of the order of a few percent if the shock speed is high enough V_s>103 km s-1, and this ratio remains nearly constant during the SNR evolution. The escape of the highest energy nuclear particles from their sources becomes progressively important with age, reducing also the cutoff in the pi^0-decay gamma-ray emission spectrum with time after the end of the sweep-up phase. Simultaneously the leptonic gamma-ray channels will gain in relative importance with increasing age of the sources.},

	Abstract = {We present 3.6-160 mum infrared images of Kepler's supernova remnant (SN 1604) obtained with the IRAC and MIPS instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We also present MIPS SED low-resolution spectra in the 55-95 mum region. The observed emission in the MIPS 24 mum band shows the entire shell. Emission in the MIPS 70 mum and IRAC 8 mum bands is seen only from the brightest regions of 24 mum emission, which also correspond to the regions seen in optical Halpha images. Shorter wavelength IRAC images are increasingly dominated by stars, although faint filaments are discernible. The SED spectrum of shows a faint continuum dropping off to longer wavelengths and confirms that strong line emission does not dominate the mid-IR spectral region. The emission we see is due primarily to warm dust emission from dust heated by the primary blast wave; no excess infrared emission is observed in regions where supernova ejecta are seen in X-rays. We use models of the dust to interpret the observed 70/24 mum ratio and constrain the allowed range of temperatures and densities. We estimate the current mass of dust in the warm dust component to be 5.4×10-4 Msolar, and infer an original mass of about 3×10-3 Msolar before grain sputtering. The MIPS 160 mum band shows no emission belonging to the remnant. We place a conservative but temperature-dependent upper limit on any cold dust component roughly a factor of 10 below the cold dust mass inferred from SCUBA observations. Finally, we comment on issues relevant to the possible precursor star and the supernova type.  Based on observations made with the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope.

	Abstract = {We investigate the observability, by direct and indirect means, of a shock precursor arising from magnetic field amplification by cosmic rays. We estimate the depth of such a precursor under conditions of nonresonant amplification, which can provide magnetic field strengths comparable to those inferred for supernova remnants. Magnetic field generation occurs as the streaming cosmic rays induce a plasma return current, and it may be quenched by either nonresonant or resonant channels. In the case of nonresonant saturation, the cosmic rays become magnetized and amplification saturates at higher magnetic fields. The precursor can extend out to 1017-1018 cm and is potentially detectable. If resonant saturation occurs, the cosmic rays are scattered by turbulence and the precursor length will likely be much smaller. The dependence of precursor length on shock velocity has implications for electron heating. In the case of resonant saturation, this dependence is similar to that in the more familiar resonantly generated shock precursor, which when expressed in terms of the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient kappav and shock velocity vs is kappav/vs . In the nonresonantly saturated case, the precursor length declines less quickly with increasing vs . Where precursor length proportional to 1/vs gives constant electron heating, this increased precursor length could be expected to lead to higher electron temperatures for nonresonant amplification. This should be expected at faster supernova remnant shocks than studied by previous works. Existing results and new data analysis of SN 1006 and Cas A suggest some observational support for this idea.},

	Abstract = {We examine the structure of the postshock region in supernova remnants (SNRs). The ``shock transition zone'' is set up by charge transfer and ionization events between atoms and ions and has a width ~(1015 cm-2)n-10, where n0 is the total preshock density (including both atoms and ions). For Balmer-dominated SNRs with shock velocity vs>~1000 km s-1, the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for ion velocity and temperature are obeyed instantly, leaving the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the broad Halpha line versus vs relation intact. However, the spatial variation in the postshock densities is relevant to the problem of Lyalpha resonant scattering in young, core-collapse SNRs. Both two- (preshock atoms and ions) and three-component (preshock atoms, broad neutrals, and ions) models are considered. We compute the spatial emissivities of the broad (xib) and narrow (xin) Halpha lines; a calculation of these emissivities in SN 1006 is in general agreement with the computed ones of Raymond and coworkers. The (dimensionless) spatial shift, Thetashift, between the centroids of xib and xin is unique for a given shock velocity and fion, the preshock ion fraction. Measurements of Thetashift can be used to constrain n0.},

	Abstract = {We derive the preshock density and scale length along the line of sight for the collisionless shock from a deep HST image that resolves the Halpha filament in SN 1006 and updated model calculations. The very deep ACS high-resolution image of the Balmer line filament in the northwest quadrant shows that 0.25 cm-3<=n0<=0.4 cm-3 and that the scale along the line of sight is about 2×1018 cm, while bright features within the filament correspond to ripples with radii of curvature less than 1/10 that size. The derived densities are within the broad range of earlier density estimates, and they agree well with the ionization timescale derived from the Chandra X-ray spectrum of a region just behind the optical filament. This provides a test for widely used models of the X-ray emission from SNR shocks. The scale and amplitude of the ripples are consistent with expectations for a shock propagating through interstellar gas with ~20% density fluctuations on parsec scales as expected from studies of interstellar turbulence. One bulge in the filament corresponds to a knot of ejecta overtaking the blast wave, however. The interaction results from the rapid deceleration of the blast wave as it encounters an interstellar cloud.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a deep (670 ks) X-ray survey of the entire SN 1006 remnant from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, together with a deep Halpha image of SN 1006 from the 4 m Blanco telescope at CTIO. Comparison with Chandra images from 2003 gives the first measurement of the X-ray proper motions around the entire periphery, carried out over a 9 yr baseline. We find that the expansion velocity varies significantly with azimuth. The highest velocity of ~7400 km s-1 (almost 2.5 times that in the northwest (NW)) is found along the southeast (SE) periphery, where both the kinematics and the spectra indicate that most of the X-ray emission stems from ejecta that have been decelerated little, if at all. Asymmetries in the distribution of ejecta are seen on a variety of spatial scales. Si-rich ejecta are especially prominent in the SE quadrant, while O and Mg are more uniformly distributed, indicating large-scale asymmetries arising from the explosion itself. Neon emission is strongest in a sharp filament just behind the primary shock along the NW rim, where the pre-shock density is highest. Here the Ne is likely interstellar, while Ne within the shell may include a contribution from ejecta. Within the interior of the projected shell we find a few isolated "bullets" of what appear to be supernova ejecta that are immediately preceded by bowshocks seen in Halpha, features that we interpret as ejecta knots that have reached relatively dense regions of the surrounding interstellar medium, but that appear in the interior in projection. Recent three-dimensional hydrodynamic models for Type Ia supernovae display small-scale features that strongly resemble the ones seen in X-rays in SN 1006 an origin in the explosion itself or from subsequent hydrodynamic instabilities both remain viable options. We have expanded the search for precursor X-ray emission ahead of a synchrotron-dominated shock front, as expected from diffusive shock acceleration theory, to numerous regions along both the northeast and southwest rims of the shell. Our data require that a precursor be thinner than about 3'', and fainter than about 5% of the post-shock peak. These limits suggest that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of seven or more in a narrow precursor region, promoting diffusive particle acceleration.  Based on observations made with NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under contract # NAS83060; the data were obtained through program GO1-12115.},

	Abstract = {We report results of infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of the SN 1006 remnant, carried out with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The 24 mum image from Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer clearly shows faint filamentary emission along the northwest rim of the remnant shell, nearly coincident with the Balmer filaments that delineate the present position of the expanding shock. The 24 mum emission traces the Balmer filaments almost perfectly but lies a few arcsec within, indicating an origin in interstellar dust heated by the shock. Subsequent decline in the IR behind the shock is presumably due largely to grain destruction through sputtering. The emission drops far more rapidly than current models predict, however, even for a higher proportion of small grains than would be found closer to the Galactic plane. The rapid drop may result in part from a grain density that has always been lower---a relic effect from an earlier epoch when the shock was encountering a lower density---but higher grain destruction rates still seem to be required. Spectra from three positions along the NW filament from the Infrared Spectrometer instrument all show only a featureless continuum, consistent with thermal emission from warm dust. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in the pre-shock interstellar medium (ISM) is lower than that expected for the Galactic ISM---as has also been observed in the analysis of IR emission from other supernova remnants, but whose cause remains unclear. As with other Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remnants, SN 1006 shows no evidence for dust grain formation in the SN ejecta.},

Although it has long been thought that these cosmic rays arise from supernovae3,4, direct evidence for such an association has been lacking. Here we report X-ray observations of the remnant of supernova 1006, made by the ASCA satellite, which indicate that emission from the edges of the remnant shell is dominated by radiation from electrons accelerated to energies of ˜ 100 TeV within the shock front. Ions in the shell are likely to have been accelerated to similar energies, thus giving rise to very-high-energy cosmic rays.},

@article{williams2013,
	Abstract = {Spitzer images of Tycho's supernova remnant in the mid-infrared reveal limb-brightened emission from the entire periphery of the shell and faint filamentary structures in the interior. As with other young remnants, this emission is produced by dust grains, warmed to ~100 K in the post-shock environment by collisions with energetic electrons and ions. The ratio of the 70 to 24 mum fluxes is a diagnostic of the dust temperature, which in turn is a sensitive function of the plasma density. We find significant variations in the 70/24 flux ratio around the periphery of Tycho's forward shock, implying order-of-magnitude variations in density. While some of these are likely localized interactions with dense clumps of the interstellar medium (ISM), we find an overall gradient in the ambient density surrounding Tycho, with densities 3-10 times higher in the northeast than in the southwest. This large density gradient is qualitatively consistent with the variations in the proper motion of the shock observed in radio and X-ray studies. Overall, the mean ISM density around Tycho is quite low (~0.1-0.2 cm-3), consistent with the lack of thermal X-ray emission observed at the forward shock. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Type Ia supernova expanding into a density gradient in the ISM, and find that the overall round shape of the remnant is still easily achievable, even for explosions into significant gradients. However, this leads to an offset of the center of the explosion from the geometric center of the remnant of up to 20%, although lower values of 10% are preferred. The best match with hydrodynamical simulations is achieved if Tycho is located at a large (3-4 kpc) distance in a medium with a mean preshock density of ~0.2 cm-3. Such preshock densities are obtained for highly (gsim 50%) porous ISM grains.},

	Abstract = {We explore the relationship between the models for progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae and the properties of the supernova remnants that evolve after the explosion. Most models for Type Ia progenitors in the single-degenerate scenario predict substantial outflows during the presupernova evolution. Expanding on previous work, we estimate the imprint of these outflows on the structure of the circumstellar medium at the time of the supernova explosion, and the effect that this modified circumstellar medium has on the evolution of the ensuing supernova remnant. We compare our simulations with the observational properties of known Type Ia supernova remnants in the Galaxy (Kepler, Tycho, SN 1006), the Large Magellanic Cloud (0509-67.5, 0519-69.0, N103B), and M31 (SN 1885). We find that optically thick outflows from the white dwarf surface (sometimes known as ``accretion winds'') with velocities above 200 km s-1 excavate large low-density cavities around the progenitors. Such large cavities are incompatible with the dynamics of the forward shock and the X-ray emission from the shocked ejecta in all the Type Ia remnants that we have examined.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we use high-quality X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra to gain new insights into the explosion that originated Tycho's supernova 433 yr ago. We perform a detailed comparison between the ejecta emission from the spatially integrated X-ray spectrum of the supernova remnant and current models for Type Ia supernova explosions. We use a grid of synthetic X-ray spectra based on hydrodynamic models of the evolution of the supernova remnant and nonequilibrium ionization calculations for the state of the shocked plasma. We find that the fundamental properties of the X-ray emission in Tycho are well reproduced by a one-dimensional delayed detonation model with a kinetic energy of ~1.2×1051 ergs. All the other paradigms for Type Ia explosions that we have tested, including one-dimensional deflagrations, pulsating delayed detonations, and sub-Chandrasekhar explosions, as well as deflagration models calculated in three dimensions, fail to provide a good approximation of the observed ejecta emission. Our results require that the supernova ejecta retain some degree of chemical stratification, with Fe peak elements interior to intermediate-mass elements. This strongly suggests that a supersonic burning front (i.e., a detonation) must be involved at some stage in the physics of Type Ia supernova explosions.},

	Abstract = {The explosion mechanism behind Type Ia supernovae is a matter of continuing debate. The diverse attempts to identify or at least constrain the physical processes involved in the explosion have been only partially successful so far. In this paper we propose to use the thermal X-ray emission from young supernova remnants (SNRs) originating in Type Ia events to extract relevant information concerning the explosions themselves. We have produced a grid of thermonuclear supernova models representative of the paradigms currently under debate: pure deflagrations, delayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations, and sub-Chandrasekhar explosions, using their density and chemical composition profiles to simulate the interaction with the surrounding ambient medium and the ensuing plasma heating, nonequilibrium ionization and thermal X-ray emission of the ejecta. Key observational parameters such as electron temperatures, emission measures, and ionization timescales are presented and discussed. We find that not only is it possible to identify the explosion mechanism from the spectra of young Type Ia SNRs, it is in fact necessary to take the detailed ejecta structure into account if such spectra are to be modeled in a self-consistent way. Neither element line flux ratios nor element emission measures are good estimates of the true ratios of ejected masses, with differences of as much as 2 or 3 orders of magnitude for a given model. Comparison with observations of the Tycho SNR suggests a delayed detonation as the most probable explosion mechanism. Line strengths, line ratios, and the centroid of the Fe Kalpha line are reasonably well reproduced by a model of this kind.},

	Abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been assumed to be the source of cosmic rays (CRs) up to the "knee" of the CR spectrum at 1015 eV, accelerating particles to relativistic energies in their blast waves by the process of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Since CR nuclei do not radiate efficiently, their presence must be inferred indirectly. Previous theoretical calculations and X-ray observations show that CR acceleration significantly modifies the structure of the SNR and greatly amplifies the interstellar magnetic field. We present new, deep X-ray observations of the remnant of Tycho's supernova (SN 1572, henceforth Tycho), which reveal a previously unknown, strikingly ordered pattern of non-thermal high-emissivity stripes in the projected interior of the remnant, with spacing that corresponds to the gyroradii of 1014-1015 eV protons. Spectroscopy of the stripes shows the plasma to be highly turbulent on the (smaller) scale of the Larmor radii of TeV energy electrons. Models of the shock amplification of magnetic fields produce structure on the scale of the gyroradius of the highest energy CRs present, but they do not predict the highly ordered pattern we observe. We interpret the stripes as evidence for acceleration of particles to near the knee of the CR spectrum in regions of enhanced magnetic turbulence, while the observed highly ordered pattern of these features provides a new challenge to models of DSA.},

	Abstract = {Although collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, certain key aspects of them are not well understood. In particular, the process known as collisionless electron heating, whereby electrons are rapidly energized at the shock front, is one of the main open issues in shock physics. Here, we present the first clear evidence for efficient collisionless electron heating at the reverse shock of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), revealed by Fe K diagnostics using high-quality X-ray data obtained by the Suzaku satellite. We detect Kbeta (3p --> 1s) fluorescence emission from low-ionization Fe ejecta excited by energetic thermal electrons at the reverse shock front, which peaks at a smaller radius than Fe Kalpha (2p --> 1s) emission dominated by a relatively highly ionized component. Comparisons with our hydrodynamical simulations imply instantaneous electron heating to a temperature 1000 times higher than expected from Coulomb collisions alone. The unique environment of the reverse shock, which is propagating with a high Mach number into rarefied ejecta with a low magnetic field strength, puts strong constraints on the physical mechanism responsible for this heating and favors a cross-shock potential created by charge deflection at the shock front. Our sensitive observation also reveals that the reverse shock radius of this SNR is about 10% smaller than the previous measurement using the Fe Kalpha morphology from the Chandra observations. Since strong Fe Kbeta fluorescence is expected only from low-ionization plasma where Fe ions still have many 3p electrons, this feature is key to diagnosing the plasma state and distribution of the immediate postshock ejecta in a young SNR.},

We find that the proper motion of the edge of the remnant (i.e., the forward shock and protruding ejecta knots) varies from 0farcs20 yr-1 (expansion index m = 0.33, where R = tm ) to 0farcs40 yr-1 (m = 0.65) with azimuthal angle in 2000-2007 measurements, and 0farcs14 yr-1 (m = 0.26) to 0farcs40 yr-1 (m = 0.65) in 2003-2007 measurements. The azimuthal variation of the proper motion and the average expansion index of ~0.5 are consistent with those derived from radio observations. We also find proper motion and expansion index of the reverse-shocked ejecta to be 0farcs21-0farcs31 yr-1 and 0.43-0.64, respectively. From a comparison of the measured m-value with Type Ia supernova evolutionary models, we find a pre-shock ambient density around the remnant of lsim0.2 cm-3.},

	Abstract = {We present evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration at the forward shock in Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) from three X-ray observables: (1) the proximity of the contact discontinuity to the forward shock, or blast wave, (2) the morphology of the emission from the rim of Tycho, and (3) the spectral nature of the rim emission. We determine the locations of the blast wave (BW), contact discontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) around the rim of Tycho's supernova remnant using a principal component analysis and other methods applied to new Chandra data. The azimuthal-angle-averaged radius of the BW is 251". For the CD and RS we find average radii of 241" and 183", respectively. Taking account of projection effects, we find ratios of 1:0.93:0.70 (BW:CD:RS). We show these values to be inconsistent with adiabatic hydrodynamic models of SNR evolution. The CD:BW ratio can be explained if cosmic-ray acceleration of ions is occurring at the forward shock. The RS:BW ratio, as well as the strong Fe Kalpha emission from the Tycho ejecta, imply that the RS is not accelerating cosmic rays. We also extract radial profiles from ~34% of the rim of Tycho and compare them to models of surface brightness profiles behind the BW for a purely thermal plasma with an adiabatic shock. The observed morphology of the rim is much more strongly peaked than predicted by the model, indicating that such thermal emission is implausible here. Spectral analysis also implies that the rim emission is nonthermal in nature, lending further support to the idea that Tycho's forward shock is accelerating cosmic rays.},

	Abstract = {The outer shells of young supernova remnants (SNRs) are the most plausible acceleration sites of high-energy electrons with the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. We studied spatial and spectral properties close to the shock fronts in four historical SNRs (Cas A, Kepler's remnant, Tycho's remnant, and RCW 86) with excellent spatial resolution of Chandra. In all of the SNRs, hard X-ray emissions were found on the rims of the SNRs, which concentrate in very narrow regions (so-called filaments); apparent scale widths on the upstream side are below or on the order of the point-spread function of Chandra, while they are 0.5"-40" (0.01-0.4 pc) on the downstream side with most reliable distances. The spectra of these filaments can be fitted with both thermal and nonthermal (power law and SRCUT) models. The former requires unrealistic high temperature (>~2 keV) and low abundances (<~1 solar) for emission from young SNRs and may be thus unlikely. The latter reproduces the spectra with best-fit photon indices of 2.1-3.8, or roll-off frequencies of (0.1-28)×1017 Hz, which reminds us of the synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated via DSA. We consider various physical parameters as functions of the SNR age, including the previous results on SN 1006; the filament width on the downstream side increases with the SNR age, and the spectrum becomes softer, keeping a nonthermal feature. It was also found that a function, that is, the roll-off frequency divided by the square of the scale width on the downstream side, shows negative correlation with the age, which might provide us some information on the DSA theory.},

	Abstract = {We report optical spectroscopy and imaging of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) which suggest that two different precursors are associated with the blast wave. In long-slit spectra of the eastern rim, we find diffuse Halpha emission extending >~1' ahead of Knot g, a bright nonradiative shock propagating at velocity ~2000 km s-1. In addition to the hydrogen lines, the diffuse spectrum also exhibits [S II] lambdalambda6716, 6731; [N II] lambda6583 and weak [O III] lambda5007 emission. Narrowband imagery of Tycho's SNR shows that the diffuse emission extends ahead of most of the Balmer-dominated optical filaments and drops sharply in the remnant interior, suggesting that the diffuse gas is overrun by the supernova shock. The line ratios of the diffuse gas are compared with predictions from a simple He II lambda304 photoionization precursor model. The models predict that the radiative transfer of He II lambda304 photons in the precursor produces spatially distinct ionization layers of H0, He0-He+, N0-N++, O0-O++, and S+-S+3 ahead of the shock. The models suggest that the diffuse emission arises from collisional excitation in mostly neutral gas which has been heated to a temperature ~12,000 K. In high-resolution echelle spectra of Knot g, we find that the narrow Halpha component is broadened to 44+/-4 km s-1, suggesting that the upstream gas may be further heated before it crosses the shock, perhaps by a fast neutral or cosmic-ray precursor. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Halpha line in both the diffuse region and Knot g will be required to definitively establish the existence of a second precursor.},

	Abstract = {The diffusive shock acceleration process can accelerate particles to a maximum energy depending on the shock speed and age and on any competing loss processes on the particles. The shock waves of young supernova remnants can easily accelerate electrons to energies in excess of 1 TeV, where they can produce X-rays by the synchrotron process. I describe a detailed calculation of the morphology and spectrum of synchrotron X-rays from supernova remnants. Remnants are assumed to be spherical and in the Sedov evolutionary phase, though the results are insensitive to the detailed dynamics. The upstream magnetic field is assumed uniform; downstream it is assumed to be compressed but not additionally turbulently amplified. In all cases, spectra begin to depart from power laws somewhere in the optical to UV range and roll off smoothly through the X-ray band. I show that simple approximations for the electron emissivity are not adequate; a full convolution of the individual electron synchrotron emissivity with a calculated electron distribution at each point in the remnant is required. Models limited by the finite shock age, by synchrotron or inverse Compton losses on electrons, or by escape of electrons above some energy have characteristically different spectral shapes, but within each class, models resemble one another strongly and can be related by simple scalings. The images and spectra depend primarily on the remnant age, the upstream magnetic field strength, and the level of magnetic turbulence near the shock in which the electrons scatter. In addition, images depend on the viewing or aspect angle between the upstream magnetic field and the line of sight. The diffusion coefficient is assumed to be proportional to particle energy (or mean free path proportional to gyroradius), but I investigate the possibility that the proportionality constant becomes much larger above some energy, corresponding to an absence of long-wavelength MHD waves. Models producing similar spectra may differ significantly in morphology, which allows for possible discriminations. I parameterize the model spectra in terms of a slope at 4 keV and a factor by which the X-ray flux density at that energy falls below the extrapolated radio spectrum. Synchrotron radiation may contribute significantly to the X-ray emission of remnants up to several thousand years old.},

@article{reynolds2009,
	Abstract = {Flows of synchrotron-emitting material can be found in several astrophysical contexts, including extragalactic jets and pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe). For X-ray synchrotron emission, flow times are often longer than electron radiative lifetimes, so the effective source size at a given X-ray energy is the distance electrons radiating at that energy can convect before they burn off. Since synchrotron losses vary strongly with electron energy, the source size drops with increasing X-ray energy, resulting in a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum. For homogeneous sources, this burnoff produces the well known result of a steepening by 0.5 in the source's integrated spectral index. However, for inhomogeneous sources, different amounts of steepening are possible. I exhibit a simple phenomenological picture of an outflow of relativistic electrons with bulk nonrelativistic flow speed, with transverse flow-tube radius, magnetic field strength, matter density, and flow velocity all varying as different powers of distance from the injection point. For such a picture, I calculate the value of the spectral index above the break as a function of the power-law indices, and show the possible range of steepenings. I show that these simple calculations are confirmed by full integrations of source luminosity, which also include the spectral "bump" below the break from the accumulation of electrons formerly at higher energies. In many cases, extragalactic jets show X-ray synchrotron emission steeper by more than 0.5 than the radio emission; the same phenomenon is exhibited by many PWNe. It is possible that source inhomogeneities are responsible in at least some cases, so that the amount of spectral steepening becomes a diagnostic for source dynamical or geometrical properties.},

	Abstract = {The self-consistent interaction between energetic particles and self-generated hydromagnetic waves in a cosmic ray pressure dominated plasma is considered. Using a three-dimensional hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-kinetic code, which utilizes a spherical harmonic expansion of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, high-resolution simulations of the magnetic field growth including feedback on the cosmic rays are carried out. It is found that for shocks with high cosmic ray acceleration efficiency, the magnetic fields become highly disorganized, resulting in near isotropic diffusion, independent of the initial orientation of the ambient magnetic field. The possibility of sub-Bohm diffusion is demonstrated for parallel shocks, while the diffusion coefficient approaches the Bohm limit from below for oblique shocks. This universal behaviour suggests that Bohm diffusion in the root-mean-squared field inferred from observation may provide a realistic estimate for the maximum energy acceleration time-scale in young supernova remnants. Although disordered, the magnetic field is not self-similar suggesting a non-uniform energy-dependent behaviour of the energetic particle transport in the precursor. Possible indirect radiative signatures of cosmic ray driven magnetic field amplification are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the damping of strong magnetic turbulence downstream of the forward shock of young supernova remnants (SNRs). We find that strong magnetic fields that have been produced by the streaming instability in the upstream region of the shock or by other kinetic instabilities at the shock may be efficiently damped, so the region of enhanced magnetic field strength would typically have a thickness of the order ld=1016-1017 cm. The nonthermal X-ray filaments observed in young SNRs are thus possibly limited by the magnetic field and not by the energy losses of the radiating electrons. Therefore, the thickness of the filaments would not be a measure of the magnetic field strength, and claims of efficient cosmic-ray acceleration on account of a runaway streaming instability would appear premature.},

	Abstract = {Constraints on the diffusion and acceleration parameters in five young supernova remnants (SNRs) are derived from the observed thickness of their X-ray rims, as limited by the synchrotron losses of the highest energy electrons, assuming uniform and isotropic turbulence. From a joint study of the electrons diffusion and advection in the downstream medium of the shock, it is shown that the magnetic field must be amplified up to values between 250 and 500 muG in the case of Cas A, Kepler, and Tycho, or ˜ 100 muG in the case of SN 1006 and G347.3-0.5. The diffusion coefficient at the highest electron energy can also be derived from the data, by relating the X-ray energy cutoff to the acceleration timescale. Values typically between 1 and 10 times the Bohm diffusion coefficient are found to be required. We also find interesting constraints on the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, by requiring that the diffusion coefficient at the maximum proton energy be not smaller than the Bohm value in the amplified field. This favours diffusion regime between the Kraichnan and the Bohm regime, and rejects turbulence spectrum indices larger than ~= 3/2. Finally, the maximum energy of the accelerated particles is found to lay between 1013 and 5× 1013 eV for electrons, and around Z× 8× 1014 eV at most for nuclei (or ˜ 2.5 times less if a Bohm diffusion regime is assumed), roughly independently of the compression ratio assumed at the shock. Even by taking advantage of the uncertainties on the measured parameters, it appears very difficult for the considered SNRs in their current stage of evolution to produce protons up to the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum, at ˜ 3× 1015 eV, and essentially impossible to accelerate Fe nuclei up to either the ankle at ˜ 3× 1018 eV or the second knee at ˜ 5× 1017 eV.},

The non-detection of this precursor in X-rays in Chandra observations of the north-eastern region of SN 1006 (G329.6+14.6) led the authors of some previous work to impose an upper limit to the X-ray emission generated by accelerated electrons diffusing in this precursor, at an emissivity level of <1.5 per cent of the emission from the downstream region. This has been used as an argument against Fermi acceleration at this shock. Here, we calculate the spectrum and spatial distribution of accelerated particles in SN 1006 and show that Chandra results (including more recent data) are in perfect agreement with the predictions of NLDSA suggesting efficient particle acceleration and MFA upstream of the shock by a factor of ~10.},

	Abstract = {Context: Efficient particle acceleration can modify the structure of supernova remnants. We present the results of a combined analysis of the XMM-Newton EPIC archive observations of SN 1006.  Aims: We attempt to describe the spatial distribution of the physical and chemical properties of the X-ray emitting plasma at the shock front. We investigate the contribution of thermal and non-thermal emission to the X-ray spectrum at the rim of the remnant to study how the acceleration processes affect the X-ray emitting plasma.  Methods: We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis of a set of regions covering the entire rim of the shell and we apply our results in producing a count-rate image of the ``pure'' thermal emission of SN 1006 in the 0.5-0.8 keV energy band (subtracting the non-thermal contribution). This image differs significantly from the total image in the same band, especially close to the bright limbs.  Results: We find that thermal X-ray emission can be associated with the ejecta and study the azimuthal variation in the physical and chemical properties of the ejecta by identifying anisotropies in the temperature and chemical composition. By employing our thermal image, we trace the position of the contact discontinuity over the entire shell and compare it with that expected from 3D MHD models of SNRs with an unmodified shock. Conclusions: We conclude that the shock is modified everywhere in the rim and that the aspect angle between the interstellar magnetic field and the line of sight is significantly lower than 90$\,^{\circ}$.},

	Abstract = {Context. Thin X-ray filaments are observed in the vicinity of young supernova remnants (SNR) blast waves. Identifying the process that creates these filaments would provide direct insight into the particle acceleration occurring within SNR and in particular the cosmic ray yield.  Aims: We investigate magnetic amplification in the upstream medium of a SNR blast wave through both resonant and non-resonant regimes of the streaming instability. We attempt to understand more clearly of the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) efficiency by considering various relaxation processes of the magnetic fluctuations in the downstream medium. Multiwavelength radiative signatures originating in the SNR shock wave are used to test various downstream turbulence relaxation models.  Methods: Analytical and numerical calculations that couple stochastic differential equation schemes with 1D spherical magnetohydrodynamics simulations are used to investigate, in the context of test particles, turbulence evolution in both the forshock and post-shock regions. Stochastic second-order Fermi acceleration induced by resonant modes, magnetic field relaxation and amplification, and turbulence compression at the shock front are considered to model the multiwavelength filaments produced in SNRs. The gamma-ray emission is also considered in terms of inverse Compton mechanism.  Results: We confirm the result of Parizot and collaborators that the maximum CR energies should not go well beyond PeV energies in young SNRs where X-ray filaments are observed. To reproduce observational data, we derive an upper limit to the magnetic field amplitude and so ensure that stochastic particle reacceleration remains inefficient. Considering various magnetic relaxation processes, we then infer two necessary conditions to achieve efficient acceleration and X-ray filaments in SNRs: (1) the turbulence must fulfil the inequality 2 - beta - delta_d >= 0; where beta is the turbulence spectral index and delta_d is the relaxation length energy power-law index; (2) the typical relaxation length must be of the order the X-ray rim size. We find that Alv{\'e}nic/fast magnetosonic mode damping fulfils all conditions; while non-linear Kolmogorov damping does not. By confronting previous relaxation processes with observational data, we deducte that among our SNR sample, data for the older ones (SN1006 and G347.3-0.5) does not comply with all conditions, which means that their X-ray filaments are probably controlled by radiative losses. The younger SNRs, Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and Kepler pass all tests and we infer that the downstream magnetic field amplitude is in the range of 200-300 muGauss.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents exact analytical solutions which describe steady-state transport of relativistic electrons subject to diffusion, convection, and radiation losses. The diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy dependent; the bulk convection velocity is considered to be constant and directed outward from the galactic plane. The electron spectral behavior with respect to galactic height and energy indicates that convection provides a 'break' in the steady-state energy spectrum without recourse to distribution of sources. Radio observations of NGC 891 and NGC 4631 galaxies can be used to estimate their diffusion coefficient and its energy dependence. Application of analytical solutions to our Galaxy indicates that the diffusion coefficient and outflow velocity deduced from relativistic electron measurements and radio observations of their synchrotron radiation agree with values based on the transport of the cosmic ray nucleonic component.},

	Abstract = {An attempt is made to evaluate the maximum energy, E(max), that particles subjected to the diffusive shock acceleration process can acquire during an SNR's lifetime. The rate of acceleration depends on the particle diffusion coefficient, which is determined by the level of hydromagnetic wave energy present at a scale that is comparable to the particle Larmor radius. Attention is given to diffusion coefficient variations as a function of momentum, space, and time. Given a realistic diffusion coefficient behavior value, an E(max) of less than about 10,000 GeV/n is obtained, signifying that supernova shock acceleration cannot account for the observed spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the 1-1,000,000 GeV/n energy range.},

We find that the proper motion of the forward shock is about 0farcs48 yr-1 and does not vary around the rim within the ~10% measurement uncertainties. The proper motion measured is consistent with that determined by previous radio observations. The mean expansion index of the forward shock is calculated to be ~0.54 which matches the value expected based on an evolutionary model of a Type Ia supernova with either a power-law or an exponential ejecta density profile. Assuming pressure equilibrium around the periphery from the thermally dominated northwestern rim to the nonthermally dominated northeastern rim, we estimate the ambient density to the northeast of SN 1006 to be ~0.085 cm-3.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that the nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) fits the shell-type nonthermal X-ray morphology, obtained in Chandra observations, in a satisfactory way. The set of empirical parameters is the same which reproduces the dynamical properties of the SNR and the spectral characteristics of the emission produced by CRs. The extremely small spatial scales of the observed X-ray distribution are due to the large effective magnetic field B_d ~  100 mu G in the interior, which is also required to give a good fit for the spatially integrated radio and X-ray synchrotron spectra. The only reasonably thinkable condition for the production of such a large effective field strength is an efficiently accelerated nuclear CR component. Therefore the Chandra data confirm the inference that SN 1006 indeed accelerates nuclear CRs with the high efficiency required for SNRs to be considered as the main Galactic CR sources.},

@article{bamba2003,
	Abstract = {The northeast shell of SN 1006 is the most probable acceleration site of high-energy electrons (up to ~100 TeV) with the Fermi acceleration mechanism at the shock front. We resolved nonthermal filaments from thermal emission in the shell with the excellent spatial resolution of Chandra. The thermal component is extended over ~100" (about 1 pc at 1.8 kpc distance) in width, consistent with the shock width derived from the Sedov solution. The spectrum is fitted with a thin thermal plasma of kT=0.24 keV in nonequilibrium ionization, typical for a young supernova remnant. The nonthermal filaments are likely thin sheets with scale widths of ~4" (0.04 pc) and ~20" (0.2 pc) upstream and downstream, respectively. The spectra of the filaments are fitted with a power-law function of index 2.1-2.3, with no significant variation from position to position. In a standard diffusive shock acceleration model, the extremely small scale length in the upstream region requires the magnetic field nearly perpendicular to the shock normal. The injection efficiency (eta) from thermal to nonthermal electrons around the shock front is estimated to be ~1×10-3 under the assumption that the magnetic field in the upstream region is 10 muG. In the filaments, the energy densities of the magnetic field and nonthermal electrons are similar to each other, and both are slightly smaller than that of thermal electrons. These results suggest that the acceleration occurs in more compact regions with larger efficiency than suggested by previous studies.},

	Abstract = {The Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) Vela Jr. (RX J0852.0-4622, G266.6-1.2) shows sharp filamentary structures on its northwestern edge in the hard X-ray band. The filaments are very smooth and located on the extreme outside edge of the remnant. We measured the averaged scale width of the filaments (wu and wd) with excellent spatial resolution with Chandra, and they are on the order of the size of the point-spread function of Chandra on the upstream side and 49.5" (36.0"-88.8") on the downstream side. The spectra of the filaments are very hard and have no linelike structure; they were well reproduced with an absorbed power-law model with Gamma=2.67 (2.55-2.77) or a SRCUT model with nuroll=4.3 (3.4-5.3)×1016 Hz under the assumption of p=0.3. These results imply that the hard X-rays are synchrotron radiation emitted by accelerated electrons, as mentioned previously. Using a correlation between the function B≡nuroll/w2d and the SNR age, we estimated the distance and the age of Vela Jr.: the estimated distance and age are 0.33 (0.26-0.50) kpc and 660 (420-1400) yr, respectively. These results are consistent with previous reports, implying that the B-age relation may be a useful tool for estimating the distance and the age of synchrotron X-ray-emitting SNRs.},

In a few supernova remnants (SN 1006, G347.3-0.5) this is the dominant form of X-ray radiation, but in most it is superposed to the dominant thermal emission. Thanks to the spectro-imaging capability of Chandra and XMM-Newton, X-ray synchrotron emission has now been unambiguously detected in most young supernova remnants (Cas A, Tycho, Kepler). It arises in a very thin shell (a few arcsecs) at the blast wave. The thinness of that shell (much broader in the radio domain) implies that the high energy electrons cool down very fast behind the shock. The magnetic field that one deduces from that constraint is more than 100 muG behind the shock.},

For acceleration to be a local effect within the Galaxy, the local scattering mean free path must be small by comparison with the effective overall galactic mean free path deduced from the cosmic-ray escape time. Given the spatial extent of the layer for strong shocks propagating into neutral interstellar clouds, the possibility of localized diffusive acceleration is investigated. The estimated strength and extent of the scattering region is not large enough to confine acceleration within the layer, which will instead extend across the entire cloud. The integrated losses of the cloud will then determine the efficiency.},

Young supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit narrow filaments of non-thermal X-ray emission whose widths can be limited either by electron energy losses or damping of the magnetic field.  Aims: We want to investigate whether or not different models of these filaments can be observationally tested.  Methods: Using observational parameters of four historical remnants, we calculated the filament profiles and compared the spectra of the filaments with those of the total non-thermal emission. For that purpose, we solved a one-dimensional stationary transport equation for the isotropic differential number density of the electrons.  Results: We find that the difference between the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission above 1 keV is more pronounced in the damping model than in the energy-loss model.  Conclusions: A considerable damping of the magnetic field can result in an observable difference between the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission, thus potentially permitting an observational discrimination between the energy-loss model and the damping model of the X-ray filaments.},

	Abstract = {We use the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to study the region in the Tycho supernova remnant between the blast wave and the shocked ejecta interface or contact discontinuity. This zone contains all the history of the shock-heated gas and cosmic-ray acceleration in the remnant. We present for the first time evidence for significant spatial variations of the X-ray synchrotron emission in the form of spectral steepening from a photon index of ~2.6 right at the blast wave to a value of ~3.0 several arcseconds behind. We interpret this result along with the profiles of radio and X-ray intensity using a self-similar hydrodynamical model including cosmic-ray back-reaction that accounts for the observed ratio of radii between the blast wave and contact discontinuity. Two different assumptions were made about the postshock magnetic field evolution: one where the magnetic field (amplified at the shock) is simply carried by the plasma flow and remains relatively high in the postshock region (synchrotron losses limited rim case), and another where the amplified magnetic field is rapidly damped behind the blast wave (magnetic damping case). Both cases fairly well describe the X-ray data; however, both fail to explain the observed radio profile. The projected synchrotron emission leaves little room for the presence of thermal emission from the shocked ambient medium. This can only be explained if the preshock ambient medium density in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova remnant is below 0.6 cm-3.},

@article{berezhko2004,
	Abstract = {It is shown that the nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) describes the shell-type nonthermal X-ray morphology of Cas A, obtained in Chandra observations, in a satisfactory way. The set of empirical parameters, like distance, source size and total energy release, is the same which reproduces the dynamical properties of the SNR and the spectral characteristics of the emission produced by CRs. The extremely small spatial scales in the observed morphological structures at hard X-ray energies are due to a large effective magnetic field B_d˜ 500 muG in the interior which is at the same time not only required but also sufficient to achieve the excellent agreement between the spatially integrated radio and X-ray synchrotron spectra and their calculated form. The only reasonably thinkable condition for the production of such a large effective field strength is a very efficiently accelerated nuclear CR component. Therefore the Chandra data confirm first of all the inference that Cas A indeed accelerates nuclear CRs with the high efficiency required for Cas A to be considered as a member of the main class of Galactic CR sources and, secondly, that the nonlinear kinetic theory of CR acceleration in SNRs is a reliable method to determine the magnetic field value in SNRs.},

	Abstract = {Thin nonthermal X-ray filaments are often seen in young supernova remnants. We used data from the 1 Ms Chandra observation of Cassiopeia A to study spectral properties of some of the filaments in this remnant. For all the cases that we examined, the X-ray spectrum across the filaments hardens, at about 10% level, going outward, while observed filament widths depend only weakly on the photon energy. Using a model that includes radiative cooling, advection, and diffusion of accelerated particles behind the shock, we estimated the magnetic field, turbulence level, and shock obliquity.},
