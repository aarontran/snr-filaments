July 2014:
Demonstration of the mysterious floating point bug that appears in original
Fortran compiled code, when compiled and invoked through f2py.

Bug doesn't appear (I think) if code is compiled and called directly w/
gfortran/terminal.  Bug sidestepped as of Aug. 2014 by Python port of full
model code.
